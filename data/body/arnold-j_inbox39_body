Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
