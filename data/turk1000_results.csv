It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.","N"

Put into a nutshell, the ruling creates a competitive marke=t for the right to transport and store natural gas along the pipelines owne=d by Southern California Gas and SDG&E, which are both subsidiaries of San =Diego-based Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE). As noted, Southern California Gas is= ranked as the largest natural-gas distribution utility in the country and =serves a territory of 23,000-square-miles that ranges from central Californ=ia to the Mexican border.Following a standard that is already in place among interstate pipelines, i=ncluding the ones that transport power into California, both of these compa=nies will now be allowed to sell large industrial customers space on their =intrastate ""backbone"" pipelines, giving customers firm transportation right=s on the pipelines. The pipelines are referred to as ""backbone"" because the=y are part of the smaller distribution system that transports power to fact=ories and power plants (along with homes and businesses). It is important t=o note that the CPUC's ruling impacts only large consumers of natural gas i=n California, which includes electric generating plants. Residential and sm=all business consumers that use natural gas will continue to have regulated= gas-transmission costs.=20Under the new auction system, power producers and industrial natural-gas cu=stomers of the two companies will bid to buy pipeline space, with preferenc=e being given to those bidders that intend to reserve space for the longest= period of time. According to the CPUC, the ruling creates three ""tiers"" of= accessibility to the capacity on the pipelines. The first tier includes re=sidential and small business customers, who are not included in the new com=petition and will automatically have about 1,044 million cubic feet per day= of capacity on the pipelines reserved for their use. The second tier inclu=des industrial customers who will now be able to participate in the competi=tion, and will be allowed to bid on half of the remaining capacity. The thi=rd tier includes all other market participants, including natural-gas marke=ters, which will be allowed to bid on whatever capacity is left. Both South=ern California Gas and SDG&E reportedly intend to phase in auctions by the =end of 2002 for their largest customers to transport natural gas. The aucti=ons will be for transmission rights that can be traded to other parties.=20The CPUC also established two different levels of payment options for the b=idding process. As one option, bidders can pay a fixed price of 7.2 cents p=er million British thermal units (MMBtu) that would cover all of the capaci=ty on the pipeline that they have reserved, regardless if it is ultimately =used or not. As a second option, bidders can pay for only 50 percent of the= reserved capacity at the fixed price of 7.2 cents per MMBtu, and 50 percen=t at a higher price that only applies to the capacity that they ultimately =use. In addition, the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, an i=mportant point that critics claim could allow buyers to gain more control o=ver the pipeline than allotted in the ruling.=20As noted, the measure passed the CPUC in a 3-2 vote. The ruling will remain= in place until 2006, at which time the commission can decide to renew it. =The three commissioners that supported the measure were Richard Bilas, Henr=y Duque and Geoffrey Brown. Loretta Lynch, president of the CPUC, and Carl =Wood voted against the measure. Wood said he opposed the measure because it= was based on data accumulated before natural-gas prices dramatically incre=ased during the winter of 2000-2001.Another reason why the three commissioners voted to approve this measure wa=s a belief that deregulating gas transmission in the state would help to ke=ep large customers from leaving intrastate pipelines in favor of using inte=rstate pipelines, which are not regulated by the CPUC. An exodus among indu=strial users from intrastate pipelines, according to the three commissioner=s, could leave residential and small business consumers with higher costs a=ssociated with maintaining the pipelines. However, regulators were quick to= qualify their vote by saying the decision to allow competition for the cos=t of transporting natural gas for industrial users did not represent total =deregulation. Instead, the commissioners said that the ruling simply amount=s to ""less regulation.""=20As I mentioned, the case against El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG) was used as an e=xample to support both sides of the debate over allowing competition among =the natural-gas intrastate pipelines. The case against El Paso Corp. is a v=ery complicated one, but it essentially comes down to one core issue. The c=ase revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November 2=000, El Paso improperly shared market-sensitive information with one of its= affiliates, which drove up natural-gas prices, pre-empted competition from= non-affiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range= of $3.7 billion for Californians. El Paso Corp. has consistently maintaine=d that it engaged in no wrongdoing. According to a report issued by the sta=te Assembly, natural-gas prices in California increased from $6.6 billion i=n 1999 to $12.3 billion in 2000 to $7.9 billion for only the first three mo=nths of 2001. In October, El Paso Corp. was absolved of the charges of mani=pulating natural-gas prices in California, but an investigation continues r=egarding any improper sharing of information between affiliates. The releva=nce of this case is that those opposed to opening up California's intrastat=e pipelines to capacity believe the new rules could allow for one company t=o step in and gain control over a portion of the pipeline and thereby be ab=le to drive up price.Those in favor of the CPUC's new ruling say the comparisons to the El Paso =case are unfounded. For starters, the ruling restricts companies from ownin=g more than 30 percent of the pipeline, which theoretically should prevent =a company from gaining an ability to control prices. Critics, however, say =that the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, which could poten=tially provide a loophole that would give a company control over more than =30 percent of pipeline capacity.=20The issue of potential price spikes associated with natural gas is one of t=he remaining questions that only time will be able to answer. Critics of th=e ruling such as TURN say allowing competition among the natural-gas pipeli=nes creates the same market dynamics as deregulation of the state's electri=city market, which some say opened the door to gaming and market manipulati=on. In other words, TURN argues, the CPUC ruling opens the door for one com=pany to enter the market and buy up a significant amount of capacity along =the intrastate gas pipelines, thereby giving that company the opportunity t=o control prices. As the new ruling won't take effect until another year wh=en Southern California Gas and SDG&E begin receiving bids for capacity spac=e on their pipelines, we won't know any time soon if prices will be impacte=d. However, critics claim that a sharp downturn in temperatures in Californ=ia during the winter season that drives up demand could be the first indica=tor of whether or not the new ruling will lead to a sharp increase in energ=y prices.Moreover, the opening of competition along capacity space on California's i=ntrastate natural-gas pipelines is a surprising departure from the state's =discontinuation of deregulation within the power sector. It is too early to= tell how the new ruling will impact energy prices, and of course this ques=tion is the source of great debate (with one side saying that prices will d=rop and the other side saying that prices will increase). Perhaps the large=r issue, however, is the control over the state's pipelines that could be i=mpacted by this ruling. Even 30-percent capacity control, the amount that t=he CPUC is opening to competition, would be considered excessive by some ot=her states. For instance, in Texas 20-percent control is considered a maxim=um standard. Again, whether or not the allowance of competition will spark =the abuse of capacity control on the intrastate pipelines is something that= remains to be seen. We do know that electric competition in California bec=ame a disastrous experiment, but even with this history the state is moving= forward with bringing competition to its intrastate natural-gas pipelines.==20An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available atwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20  _____ =20We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

Competition Approved for California's Intrastate Natural-Gas Pipelines=20

[News item from Associated Press] California state power regulators voted D=

ec. 11 to deregulate further the transmission of natural gas within Souther=

n California, a decision hailed by the industry and derided by consumer adv=

ocates. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted 3-2 to appr=

ove a proposal that allows Southern California Gas Co., the nation's larges=

t gas utility, and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (SDG&E) to sell space on th=

eir ""backbone"" transmission pipelines. These pipelines carry natural gas fr=

om out of state to a smaller distribution system in California that then tr=

ansports it to homes, businesses, factories, and power plants.



Analysis: This controversial vote by the CPUC took place last week, but has=

 not received a great amount of industry analysis. This is rather surprisin=

g because the vote carries enormous potential impact for the way in which n=

atural-gas capacity is bought and sold along pipelines owned by Southern Ca=

lifornia Gas Co. and SDG&E in the southern part of the state. Considering t=

he fiasco that opening the state's electric market became over the last yea=

r, it is a risky move for California's regulators to open a competitive mar=

ket for the right to transport gas along these pipelines at this time, even=

 though the issue has been under debate at the commission for years. Howeve=

r, the rationale for the decision is that the new system will allow custome=

rs to better control the point from which their natural-gas supply originat=

es, which theoretically should lower costs and preserve space along the pip=

elines that the customers don't need. Critics of the plan, especially The U=

tility Reform Network (TURN), say that allowing competition along the natur=

al-gas pipelines in California could allow fewer companies to control most =

of the pipeline space, which could in fact cause the opposite of the intend=

ed effect and drive up energy costs. A case that has been used by both side=

s of the debate is that of El Paso Corp., which found itself in a lengthy l=

awsuit this year when it was charged with giving preferential access to its=

 pipeline to one of its affiliates, which allegedly played a role in drivin=

g up energy costs in the state.



Before analyzing the potential impact of the CPUC's ruling, let's first est=

ablish specifically what the ruling entails and some background of the comp=

anies involved. Put into a nutshell, the ruling creates a competitive marke=

t for the right to transport and store natural gas along the pipelines owne=

d by Southern California Gas and SDG&E, which are both subsidiaries of San =

Diego-based Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE). As noted, Southern California Gas is=

 ranked as the largest natural-gas distribution utility in the country and =

serves a territory of 23,000-square-miles that ranges from central Californ=

ia to the Mexican border.



Following a standard that is already in place among interstate pipelines, i=

ncluding the ones that transport power into California, both of these compa=

nies will now be allowed to sell large industrial customers space on their =

intrastate ""backbone"" pipelines, giving customers firm transportation right=

s on the pipelines. The pipelines are referred to as ""backbone"" because the=

y are part of the smaller distribution system that transports power to fact=

ories and power plants (along with homes and businesses). It is important t=

o note that the CPUC's ruling impacts only large consumers of natural gas i=

n California, which includes electric generating plants. Residential and sm=

all business consumers that use natural gas will continue to have regulated=

 period of time. According to the CPUC, the ruling creates three ""tiers"" of=

 accessibility to the capacity on the pipelines. The first tier includes re=

sidential and small business customers, who are not included in the new com=

petition and will automatically have about 1,044 million cubic feet per day=

 of capacity on the pipelines reserved for their use. The second tier inclu=

des industrial customers who will now be able to participate in the competi=

tion, and will be allowed to bid on half of the remaining capacity. The thi=

rd tier includes all other market participants, including natural-gas marke=

ters, which will be allowed to bid on whatever capacity is left. Both South=

ern California Gas and SDG&E reportedly intend to phase in auctions by the =

end of 2002 for their largest customers to transport natural gas. The aucti=

ons will be for transmission rights that can be traded to other parties.=20



The CPUC also established two different levels of payment options for the b=

idding process. As one option, bidders can pay a fixed price of 7.2 cents p=

er million British thermal units (MMBtu) that would cover all of the capaci=

ty on the pipeline that they have reserved, regardless if it is ultimately =

used or not. As a second option, bidders can pay for only 50 percent of the=

 reserved capacity at the fixed price of 7.2 cents per MMBtu, and 50 percen=

t at a higher price that only applies to the capacity that they ultimately =

use. In addition, the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, an i=

mportant point that critics claim could allow buyers to gain more control o=

ver the pipeline than allotted in the ruling.=20



As noted, the measure passed the CPUC in a 3-2 vote. The ruling will remain=

 in place until 2006, at which time the commission can decide to renew it. =

The three commissioners that supported the measure were Richard Bilas, Henr=

y Duque and Geoffrey Brown. Loretta Lynch, president of the CPUC, and Carl =

Wood voted against the measure. Wood said he opposed the measure because it=

 was based on data accumulated before natural-gas prices dramatically incre=

ased during the winter of 2000-2001.



Another reason why the three commissioners voted to approve this measure wa=

s a belief that deregulating gas transmission in the state would help to ke=

ep large customers from leaving intrastate pipelines in favor of using inte=

rstate pipelines, which are not regulated by the CPUC. An exodus among indu=

strial users from intrastate pipelines, according to the three commissioner=

s, could leave residential and small business consumers with higher costs a=

ssociated with maintaining the pipelines. However, regulators were quick to=

 qualify their vote by saying the decision to allow competition for the cos=

t of transporting natural gas for industrial users did not represent total =

deregulation. Instead, the commissioners said that the ruling simply amount=

s to ""less regulation.""=20



As I mentioned, the case against El Paso Corp. (NYSE: EPG) was used as an e=

xample to support both sides of the debate over allowing competition among =

the natural-gas intrastate pipelines. The case against El Paso Corp. is a v=

ery complicated one, but it essentially comes down to one core issue. The c=

ase revolves around allegations that during the period of May to November 2=

000, El Paso improperly shared market-sensitive information with one of its=

 affiliates, which drove up natural-gas prices, pre-empted competition from=

 non-affiliated companies and resulted in extra costs for fuel in the range=

 of $3.7 billion for Californians. El Paso Corp. has consistently maintaine=

d that it engaged in no wrongdoing. According to a report issued by the sta=

te Assembly, natural-gas prices in California increased from $6.6 billion i=

n 1999 to $12.3 billion in 2000 to $7.9 billion for only the first three mo=

nths of 2001. In October, El Paso Corp. was absolved of the charges of mani=

pulating natural-gas prices in California, but an investigation continues r=

egarding any improper sharing of information between affiliates. The releva=

nce of this case is that those opposed to opening up California's intrastat=

e pipelines to capacity believe the new rules could allow for one company t=

o step in and gain control over a portion of the pipeline and thereby be ab=

le to drive up price.



Those in favor of the CPUC's new ruling say the comparisons to the El Paso =

case are unfounded. For starters, the ruling restricts companies from ownin=

g more than 30 percent of the pipeline, which theoretically should prevent =

a company from gaining an ability to control prices. Critics, however, say =

that the ruling allows for the trading of capacity space, which could poten=

tially provide a loophole that would give a company control over more than =

30 percent of pipeline capacity.=20



The issue of potential price spikes associated with natural gas is one of t=

he remaining questions that only time will be able to answer. Critics of th=

e ruling such as TURN say allowing competition among the natural-gas pipeli=

nes creates the same market dynamics as deregulation of the state's electri=

city market, which some say opened the door to gaming and market manipulati=

on. In other words, TURN argues, the CPUC ruling opens the door for one com=

pany to enter the market and buy up a significant amount of capacity along =

the intrastate gas pipelines, thereby giving that company the opportunity t=

o control prices. As the new ruling won't take effect until another year wh=

en Southern California Gas and SDG&E begin receiving bids for capacity spac=

e on their pipelines, we won't know any time soon if prices will be impacte=

d. However, critics claim that a sharp downturn in temperatures in Californ=

ia during the winter season that drives up demand could be the first indica=

tor of whether or not the new ruling will lead to a sharp increase in energ=

y prices.



Moreover, the opening of competition along capacity space on California's i=

ntrastate natural-gas pipelines is a surprising departure from the state's =

discontinuation of deregulation within the power sector. It is too early to=

 tell how the new ruling will impact energy prices, and of course this ques=

tion is the source of great debate (with one side saying that prices will d=

rop and the other side saying that prices will increase). Perhaps the large=

r issue, however, is the control over the state's pipelines that could be i=

mpacted by this ruling. Even 30-percent capacity control, the amount that t=

he CPUC is opening to competition, would be considered excessive by some ot=

her states. For instance, in Texas 20-percent control is considered a maxim=

um standard. Again, whether or not the allowance of competition will spark =

the abuse of capacity control on the intrastate pipelines is something that=

 remains to be seen. We do know that electric competition in California bec=

ame a disastrous experiment, but even with this history the state is moving=

 forward with bringing competition to its intrastate natural-gas pipelines.=

due by March 1, to be effective May 1.=20

=20

FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm=

itted to fix: limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail=

 the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a de=

monstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work=

 with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar=

rier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be=

 exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources,=

 including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted fro=

m or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted beca=

use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market p=

ower. FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w=

ell; (3) file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how t=

he AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in e=

ffect or proposed, including the in-city mitigation  measures. FERC is conc=

erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i=

nconsistencies and gaps; and (4) consider must-run  mitigation measures con=

sistent with ISO-NE and PJM. Again, FERC seems to be concerned here with tr=

ansmission constraints within NYC. (Note that the Con Ed distribution syste=

m is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the ou=

t-of-merit calls in the City.)  Finally, FERC cautions the NYISO that it ex=

pects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process, and=

 it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its M=

arch 1 comprehensive mitigation plan.

(NYSE: AES) has forced a showdown with the U.S.-based global =power company by announcing a share repurchase program. The Board of Direct=ors of CANTV, Venezuela's biggest telecommunications company, recommended t=hat shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to 15 perce=nt of CANTV's shares at a price of $30 per American Depositary Share (ADS),= or approximately $4.29 per share. Analysts said the CANTV Board's proposal=s, which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set= for Oct. 24, clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES.=20Analysis: AES' expansion in Latin America's telecommunications market was a=lways seen as a risky move, and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi=g bite out of the company's strategy. CANTV, which was an appealing takeove=r target for AES due to its long-standing monopoly over the telecom market =in Venezuela, has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications (NYSE=: VZ), which holds a 28.5-percent stake in the company. Verizon came out in= support of the 15-percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV, whic=h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES' efforts to gain c=ontrol over the company. The repurchase could be seen as a power play, with= Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV, which many analysts m=ight see as a more appropriate synergy. However, this story also highlights= the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ=a, especially since CANTV's resistance comes on the heels of AES' pulling o=ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador.=20For background, it is important to note that AES already owns 6.9 percent o=f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas, Venezuel=a's largest private electricity company. Thus, the takeover effort is an at=tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from =Verizon. CANTV, which was privatized a decade ago, is a full-service teleco=mmunications provider offering switched and local, domestic and internation=al long-distance service throughout Venezuela Company. CANTV also offers mo=bile cellular services, wireless services, Internet access and other value-=added services, and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nationa=l network of public telephone lines. CANTV became privatized about 10 years= ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixed-line teleph=one service in Venezuela. The company has a market capitalization of $2.6 b=illion.=20AES had bid $24 in cash for each of the 28.57-million U.S.-listed shares in= CANTV and $3.43 in cash for each of the 200 million shares of CANTV traded= in Venezuela. AES' offer for CANTV's American shares represents a 9.2-perc=ent premium over CANTV's closing price of $21.98 on Aug. 29, the time at wh=ich the takeover effort was launched. From the start of the offer, some cri=tics charged that this bid was too low, but AES has maintained that the off=er is fair. AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTV's mobile services, which= account for about a quarter of the company's revenues, and distribute the =proceeds to shareholders.=20CANTV was never very receptive to AES' bid, and did consider it to be a hos=tile takeover. In fact, workers' representatives at CANTV circulated a stat=ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES, stating that the deal would s=everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers. CANTV employees hold a 10.9-per=cent interest in the company. Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan=ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock. Note that CANTV wil=l most likely issue the buyback program at $30, compared to the $24 that AE=S had offered.

AES Hits Brick Wall in Venezuelan Acquisition=20

[News item from Reuters] Venezuelan telecommunications firm CANTV, or Compa=

nia Anomima Nacional Telefonos, facing a $1.37-billion hostile takeover bid=

 by AES Corp. (NYSE: AES) has forced a showdown with the U.S.-based global =

power company by announcing a share repurchase program. The Board of Direct=

ors of CANTV, Venezuela's biggest telecommunications company, recommended t=

hat shareholders approve a proposed share buyback program of up to 15 perce=

nt of CANTV's shares at a price of $30 per American Depositary Share (ADS),=

 or approximately $4.29 per share. Analysts said the CANTV Board's proposal=

s, which would be submitted to shareholders at an extraordinary meeting set=

 for Oct. 24, clearly flung down the gauntlet to AES.=20



Analysis: AES' expansion in Latin America's telecommunications market was a=

lways seen as a risky move, and now that risk seems to be resulting in a bi=

g bite out of the company's strategy. CANTV, which was an appealing takeove=

r target for AES due to its long-standing monopoly over the telecom market =

in Venezuela, has a strong ally in the form of Verizon Communications (NYSE=

: VZ), which holds a 28.5-percent stake in the company. Verizon came out in=

 support of the 15-percent repurchase program being launched by CANTV, whic=

h clearly is a form of aggressive resistance against AES' efforts to gain c=

ontrol over the company. The repurchase could be seen as a power play, with=

 Verizon also seeking to increase its share in CANTV, which many analysts m=

ight see as a more appropriate synergy. However, this story also highlights=

 the difficulty that AES has had with its expansion efforts in Latin Americ=

a, especially since CANTV's resistance comes on the heels of AES' pulling o=

ut of another acquisition project in Ecuador.=20



For background, it is important to note that AES already owns 6.9 percent o=

f CANTV through its majority ownership of Electricidad de Caracas, Venezuel=

a's largest private electricity company. Thus, the takeover effort is an at=

tempt to gain majority ownership of the company and take control away from =

Verizon. CANTV, which was privatized a decade ago, is a full-service teleco=

mmunications provider offering switched and local, domestic and internation=

al long-distance service throughout Venezuela Company. CANTV also offers mo=

bile cellular services, wireless services, Internet access and other value-=

added services, and owns all of the Venezuelan public exchanges and nationa=

l network of public telephone lines. CANTV became privatized about 10 years=

 ago and until last year reportedly had a monopoly on the fixed-line teleph=

one service in Venezuela. The company has a market capitalization of $2.6 b=

illion.=20



AES had bid $24 in cash for each of the 28.57-million U.S.-listed shares in=

 CANTV and $3.43 in cash for each of the 200 million shares of CANTV traded=

 in Venezuela. AES' offer for CANTV's American shares represents a 9.2-perc=

ent premium over CANTV's closing price of $21.98 on Aug. 29, the time at wh=

ich the takeover effort was launched. From the start of the offer, some cri=

tics charged that this bid was too low, but AES has maintained that the off=

er is fair. AES reportedly plans to sell off CANTV's mobile services, which=

 account for about a quarter of the company's revenues, and distribute the =

proceeds to shareholders.=20



CANTV was never very receptive to AES' bid, and did consider it to be a hos=

tile takeover. In fact, workers' representatives at CANTV circulated a stat=

ement strongly objecting to the bid from AES, stating that the deal would s=

everely damage Venezuela and CANTV workers. CANTV employees hold a 10.9-per=

cent interest in the company. Now we see that CANTV is upping that resistan=

ce a notch by attempting a repurchase of its own stock. Note that CANTV wil=

l most likely issue the buyback program at $30, compared to the $24 that AE=

S had offered. Thus, the challenge for AES, if it still wants to gain contr=

ol over CANTV, will be to increase its already 9.2-percent premium offer. T=

he word circulating in the industry is that AES still intends to proceed wi=

th its takeover attempt, and the CANTV strategy will not derail these attem=

pts.=20



AES' rationale for increasing its holdings in the company is most likely tw=

ofold in nature. First, AES obviously finds great appeal in the Latin Ameri=

can market as the company already owns electricity assets in Brazil, Chile =

and other countries. Just this week, AES announced its penetration of the A=

rgentina market by inking a $376-million deal to purchase distribution and =

generation assets in that country from New Jersey-based Public Service Ente=

rprise Group (PSEG). In another recent announcement, AES launched a cash te=

nder offer to acquire all of the outstanding loan participation certificate=

s of Empresa Electrica del Norte Grande in northern Chile, a company that c=

onsists of 716 MW of generation and 1,056 kilometers of transmission. In fa=

ct, AES reportedly rivals Spain's Endesa as the region's most dominant powe=

r company and by all appearances now derives a large part of its business t=

hroughout Latin America. Whereas AES was clearly diversified across the Uni=

ted States, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, many investors now perceive th=

e company as moving into a heavier focus on Latin America, which constitute=

s a risky proposition in and of itself due to unique politics in the variou=

s Latin American countries.=20



However, AES recently pulled out of its attempt to launch a $128-million ta=

keover bid for Chilean generator Edelnor. Currently, Edelnor, which is one =

of the largest electrical generators in Chile, is controlled by Mirant Corp=

., one of AES' direct competitors in the independent power producing market=

. Perhaps also reacting to the volatility in the region, Mirant has announc=

ed that it will not sink any additional capital into the Edelnor unit unles=

s it can be assured of repayment. AES did not give a reason for its decisio=

n to terminate the Edelnor takeover, but one can surmise that investor reac=

tor to its ongoing efforts in Venezuela may have been a significant factor.=

 Further, on Sept. 25, AES cut its earnings estimate for 2001 to a range of=

 $1.25 to $1.45 per share from a previous range of $1.75 to $1.90. AES blam=

ed poor currency exchange rates between the Brazilian real and U.S. dollar,=

 lower U.K. power prices, and the company's inability to replace earnings a=

nticipated from the planned acquisition of the Mohave power plant. The drop=

 in AES' earnings estimate may have lowered available capital that the comp=

any needed to purchase Edelnor.=20



AES shares were priced at $24.25 prior to the earnings revision. After the =

announcement, at least as of early morning trading on Sept. 27, AES shares =

were priced at $12.25, significantly down from the 52-week high of $73, whi=

ch is what the stock was priced at a year ago. As of early morning trading =

on Oct. 17, AES shares were priced at $14.81.=20

9 (a day on which many stocks fell) AES' stock closed down $2.94, or 8.3 pe=

Dennis Bakke immediately attempted to reassure investors that the purchase =

did not represent a change of strategy for AES, which he says will remain f=

cipe from an investor's perspective, at least as of today.=20



In fairness to AES, penetrating the Venezuelan market could represent a ver=

y strategic move from a long-term perspective. With a population of 23.5 mi=

llion, Venezuela represents a large potential market for energy and other r=

ies totaling over 44 gigawatts of capacity worldwide. This business model w=

orked well for AES and was well received by investors. Any perceived deviat=

ion from this successful strategy-especially if it includes expansion into =

the dangerous territory of telecom-could mark a new and risky era for AES.=

MikeBrosnan, deputy comptroller of risk evaluation at the 0CC, pointed to achallenge in assembling these surveys:""When you conduct a survey, some people may or may not respond, hence thedata could be incomplete. A problem with a survey is: who is the enforcer?'

Neuman club of stockanalysts, rating agencies and the SEC. It may even prove to be a fascinatinglook into criminal minds. But there is one thing, for sure, it wasn't -- amarket failure. To the contrary, Enron's implosion was confirmation of theprinciples that govern competitive markets.Enron's success and failure ran along the lines set down in anymicroeconomics text. The company discovered a new product -- mostly ways oftrading energy in the derivatives market -- that allowed producers and usersto lay off risk. This new product was wildly popular and, as the innovator,Enron made lovely above-market returns. But those abnormal returns attractedother firms into the business and Enron's advantage was gradually ""competedaway."" Each new market entrant put the squeeze on Enron's margins.What happened next is still a matter of speculation, but there are severaltheories that seem reasonable.Bad hedging. Although Enron started out as a plain vanilla energy company,it shed those hard assets that could have underpinned its financial businessand morphed into a trading company and then, quickly, into a hedge fund. The Dismal Science A trading company can make money no matter which direction the market goesby simply trading and taking its money from creating a market. If prices arefalling, then suppliers rush into the market to get contracts that nail downprices; if prices are rising, then users rush in to get contracts. Traderscan make money either way. Indeed, in this model, a volatile market is thebest of all possible worlds.But with its margins -- and cash -- getting squeezed, Enron startedborrowing money and pretty soon it was running with remarkable leverage,thus becoming a giant hedge fund. When things started to go wrong, Enron'straders quite possibly were panicked into trying to hit a home run. That is,they started taking big bets on the direction of the market, perhaps takingaggressively long positions in energy. A successful hedge fund, however,depends on adequately hedging bets, especially leveraged ones. But as Enronstarted to lose money on its big bets, observers guess that theinsufficiency of its hedges began to look lethal.There are also more complicated theories that argue Enron was hiding itsslowing growth in earnings with various accounting strategies.Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday.Enron's collapse also says something valuable about the energy tradingmarkets: Competitive markets worked just as expected. As questions wereraised about the quality of Enron's earnings -- and, just as important, notanswered -- investors grew wary. Although the stock opened the year tradingin the 80s, it started drifting down as investors bailed. The stock hadalready lost half its value and was trading below 40 before the companyannounced a big third-quarter loss and made its first disclosure ofaccounting ""mistakes"" in October.At the same time, traders outside the company had begun to unwind positionsand do business with other firms. At the end of September, Enron had 25% ofthe energy-trading market. Just two months later, its business haddisappeared but that disappearance didn't cause the tiniest ripple in themarket. The swift collapse of what once was a $77 billion dollar companyfailed to generate either a price spike or a supply interruption because themarket was sufficiently liquid and deep to absorb it.In short, no matter how one views the purposes or operations of acompetitive market, the history of Enron proves that the market works prettymuch as expected. And thus the story of Enron is, so far, a success story.**End of ISDA Press Report for December 26, 2001**THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'SBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

CREDIT DERIVATIVES
ISDA publishes credit survey - Risk

ENERGY
Enron's Success Story - The Wall Street Journal
 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association released its first
survey of the global over-the-counter credit derivatives market last month,
showing a total notional outstanding volume of credit derivative
transactions of $631.5 billion as of the end of the first half of this year.
ISDA, which compiled information from 83 firms, hopes the survey will
provide a benchmark from which to chart future growth in the credit
derivatives market. This survey, and the others that have been done by Risk,
the British Bankers' Association (BBA), the US Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (0CC) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have all
used different methodologies on different samples, and have generated
varying results.

Risk's survey last year showed significantly higher total notional volumes
$810 billion. The BBA survey released in July 2000 also gave a higher
figure, forecasting $893 billion for the end of 2000. The BJS plans to
publish its triennial figures on the credit derivatives market later this
year.

Upward trend
According to ISDA, while still modest in relation to interest rate products,
the credit derivatives market is expected to remain on a strong upward trend
compared to more mature derivatives product areas. Most major dealers say
there has been a big increase in their credit derivatives volumes.  Mike
Brosnan, deputy comptroller of risk evaluation at the 0CC, pointed to a
challenge in assembling these surveys:
""When you conduct a survey, some people may or may not respond, hence the
data could be incomplete. 

A problem with a survey is: who is the enforcer?' The OCC. which carries out
its own quarterly review of the US derivatives market, showed a decline in
the credit derivatives market, from $426 billion at the end of 2000 to $351
billion at the end of second-quarter 2001.
Brosnan attributes the decline in the credit derivatives market to
uncertainty among users, relating to restructuring issues sparked off by the
US life insurer Conseco's debt restructuring last year. However, according
to Tim Frost, head of JP Morgan's credit derivatives business in London, the
decline evidenced in the OCC's figures really comes down to a change in
reporting methods that occurred in 2000 from gross-to-net notional figures
on outstanding credit derivatives contracts. 


Enron's Success Story
The Wall Street Journal - December 26, 2001

The collapse of Enron was many things -- a gratifying slap in the face to
corporate hubris and an exposure of the Alfred E. Neuman club of stock
analysts, rating agencies and the SEC. It may even prove to be a fascinating
look into criminal minds. But there is one thing, for sure, it wasn't -- a
market failure. To the contrary, Enron's implosion was confirmation of the
principles that govern competitive markets.

Enron's success and failure ran along the lines set down in any
microeconomics text. The company discovered a new product -- mostly ways of
trading energy in the derivatives market -- that allowed producers and users
to lay off risk. This new product was wildly popular and, as the innovator,
Enron made lovely above-market returns. But those abnormal returns attracted
other firms into the business and Enron's advantage was gradually ""competed
away."" Each new market entrant put the squeeze on Enron's margins.

What happened next is still a matter of speculation, but there are several
theories that seem reasonable.

Bad hedging. Although Enron started out as a plain vanilla energy company,
it shed those hard assets that could have underpinned its financial business
and morphed into a trading company and then, quickly, into a hedge fund. 

The Dismal Science
 
A trading company can make money no matter which direction the market goes
by simply trading and taking its money from creating a market. If prices are
falling, then suppliers rush into the market to get contracts that nail down
prices; if prices are rising, then users rush in to get contracts. Traders
can make money either way. Indeed, in this model, a volatile market is the
best of all possible worlds.

But with its margins -- and cash -- getting squeezed, Enron started
borrowing money and pretty soon it was running with remarkable leverage,
thus becoming a giant hedge fund. When things started to go wrong, Enron's
traders quite possibly were panicked into trying to hit a home run. That is,
they started taking big bets on the direction of the market, perhaps taking
aggressively long positions in energy. A successful hedge fund, however,
depends on adequately hedging bets, especially leveraged ones. But as Enron
started to lose money on its big bets, observers guess that the
insufficiency of its hedges began to look lethal.

There are also more complicated theories that argue Enron was hiding its
slowing growth in earnings with various accounting strategies.

Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolved
around a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.
Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fair
value"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, the
futures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market with
clear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies can
vastly inflate value. 

These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. In
September 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look at
Enron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron would
have had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,
unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company's
originally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in the
quality of Enron's earnings.

When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enron
removed the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in special
entities created for just that purpose.

Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hard

order to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,
the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- either

(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them off
Enron's balance sheet. 

Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enron
stock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of the
partnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisions
kicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholder
equity in November.

Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.

The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it is
entirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanos

disappeared but that disappearance didn't cause the tiniest ripple in the
market. The swift collapse of what once was a $77 billion dollar company
failed to generate either a price spike or a supply interruption because the
market was sufficiently liquid and deep to absorb it.

In short, no matter how one views the purposes or operations of a
competitive market, the history of Enron proves that the market works pretty
much as expected. And thus the story of Enron is, so far, a success story.

This sector is thebackbone and growth engine of many major economies. Now, nearly a yearlater, the issue has come to a head. The US and Germany - which is fiercelyprotective of its SME sector, the mittelstand - are engaged in brinkmanshipover the capital treatment of loans to SMEs that could cause the entireBasel II capital Accord to unravel.SME lenders' initial concerns included the steepness of Basel's credit riskweighting curve for the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, itsinsistence that expected loss provisions should be made in addition totypical unexpected loss provisions, confusion over which SME loans could beincluded under the retail approach, and the extent to which physicalcollateral could be used as a risk mitigant. The Committee has moved toaddress many of these concerns, although some, like the risk weightingcurve, remain prickly. But a critical issue, the use of maturity adjustmentsin the calculation of capital charges for corporate and SME lending, whichrequires banks to put aside more capital for longer-dated loans, is far frombeing settled.The German banking industry in particular is worried that overly harsh SMEtreatment would push up lending costs, thereby stifling capital to a vitalsource of the country's economic growth. While German banks have severalconcerns, the country's lack of flexibility on the maturity issue threatensto derail the entire Basel II process, which in turn would throw theEuropean Directive based on Basel II into disarray.While most Basel lobbying has been carried out via traditional bankingchannels - with national banking associations petitioning their regulatorsthat sit on the Basel Committee and its working groups - the debate inGermany, Europe's largest economy, involves the highest levels ofgovernment. German chancellor Gerhard Schr?der and economics minister WernerM?ller said in late October that German funding to the mittelstand must notbe impaired by Basel II. ""Basel II is not acceptable to Germany in itspresent form. Everyone must reckon with our opposition to a European Unionguideline based on Basel II,"" said Schr?der, referring specifically totreatment of SMEs.The Basel Committee has since issued a paper, 'Potential modifications tothe Committee's proposals', which outlines current thinking within theCommittee and indicates that it will make key concessions to SME lenders.The most important aspect of the paper, released November 5, is theCommittee's move to lower and flatten the IRB risk weighting capital curve -which is a function of a firm's probability of default. This significantlylowers capital requirements for SME lending. The move is based on evidencethat small companies are less likely than large corporates to default duringeconomic downturns.But the paper failed to touch on the maturity debate. ""[It] says nothingabout maturity, just about the risk weights without any maturityadjustments,"" says Tobias Winkler, head of international banking issues inthe department for banking supervision at the Bundesverband deutscher Banken(Association of German Commercial Banks). ""This a right step, but certainadditional things have to be done to take account of special circumstancesof SME lending [in Germany],"" he adds. ""The maturity adjustment has to beabolished in the advanced approach,"" he argues.The German side claims the terms of loans to the mittelstand aresignificantly longer than those to their SME counterparts in the US or theUK.""We have got very long maturities, this would put German banks at anenormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries,"" saysWinkler.Evidence to support this argument is hard to come by, especially since theBasel Committee refuses to disclose cross-country comparisons for factorslike average loan maturities from its second quantitative impact study (QIS2). But several officials with access to QIS 2 data say the average maturityof loans made by domestic financial institutions to businesses in Germany is4.28 years, a figure that falls to 2.95 years for Germany's internationallyactive banks. Average maturities for business loans in other G-10 countrieswere said to lie between two and 2.5 years. The CP2 proposals for Basel II contained two maturity approaches in IRBtreatment, one called the 'default model', ironically said to be a Germanproposal, and the other a US 'mark-to-market' approach strongly backed bythe British. Under these two approaches, it is assumed that the risk ofdefault on a loan is higher if it is longer-dated, an assertion that hasbeen supported by several studies of historic data. The 'mark-to-market'approach also takes into account the economic deterioration of the positionand not just final default. This Anglo model heavily penalises longer-termloans. According to the Zentraler Kreditausschus (ZKA), a central bankingassociation which represents the interests of German commercial banks,savings banks, regional state banks and co-operatives, long-term exposuresof seven years could require up to six times as much capital as one yearexposures - although one German banking official said a cap had now beenplaced on maturities at five years, reducing this figure to 400%. ""Capitaladd-ons for long-term loans would therefore seriously affect theinternational competitiveness of the German banking industry and result inhigher interest rates for borrowers that would not be justified by the riskexposure,"" said the ZKA in a statement during the comment period.But Germany stands virtually alone in its refusal to accept the US-ledmaturity proposals. ""The data analysed by the Committee clearly shows thatyou have these upward-sloping curves for maturities. What kills a bank isdeterioration of value, and it has got to provide for a lot of things on thebooks, so you can't wait for final default,"" said a Basel Committee member.""But you can argue about the steepness, and that is a matter for debate.""The fact that Germany's other key allies in the wider SME debate - namelyJapan, Italy and Spain - are in favour of maturity adjustments, has prompteda number of non-German regulators, albeit veiled behind the protection ofanonymity, to play down the importance of the maturity impasse to Basel II'simplementation. But such views fail to take into account the depth offeeling that German banks, banking associations, the Bundesbank, parliamentand the general public have in protecting funding to the mittlestand. Thisunusual level of pressure has left the German negotiators with very littleroom for manoeuvre.Gerhard Hofmann, director of banking supervision at the Deutsche Bundesbank,was one of the few regulators prepared to speak publicly on the issue. Hesaid his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate, and confirmed thatthe German side would be prepared to scupper Basel II's timetable should adeal fail to be reached. ""If this does not come to an end, then the Europeaneffort will be postponed too. I have difficulties imagining that we wouldintroduce Basel II in Europe and not have a level playing field on a G-10basis."" While Hofmann said the matter was ""very serious"", he remainedconfident that all sides could reach a solution. CompromiseRisk was told by one European banking representative who claims to beclosely involved in the talks that a current compromise suggestion is tohalve the US mark-to-market maturity adjustments. This would mean the 600%figure mentioned in the ZKA paper for a 'AAA'-rated, seven-year loan wouldbe reduced to 200%. But a US representative distanced himself from thisbeing a US proposal. ""I would not describe the negotiating position thatway,"" he said. Asked if the US team would agree such a concession, he added,""I couldn't say that we would, but it would depend on the whole package.Fifty per cent on the mark-to-market adjustment seems an obvious point totry and compromise on, but I'm not sure the US side would agree to that.""Hofmann was also cautious, saying ""I would rather hesitate to comment onthat, but yes, it is a direction we are heading. This is a critical pointand I hesitate to comment in public because we are in the midst of thisrather difficult negotiating process and I really don't want to jeopardiseanything. It will be quite tough.""  While almost every country that supportsmaturity adjustments believes a 50% mark-down would be an acceptablecompromise, Germany may still hold out. Another German bank executive saysit may find a 50% mark-down unsatisfactory.Another area of potential compromise is to allow banks with loan maturitiesof less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment,while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at thethree-year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised creditapproach. But German bankers appear set to resist even this level of compromise,claiming that German internationally active banks (with average maturitiesof 2.95 years) would be on an unfair playing field with otherinternationally active banks, which have average maturities closer to thetwo years. But German banking officials could not come up with hard data tosupport the claims.While maturity is the largest single SME-related issue for the BaselCommittee to resolve, there are a number of other matters that also needclearing up, and, once again, the Germans are digging in their heels. Forexample, the IRB credit risk-weighting curve proposed by the Committee onNovember 5 fails to completely assuage concern about higher SME lendingcharges. While Basel's current approach would mean that banks would have toset aside significantly less capital against SMEs, which typically fall inthe 1% to 3% probability of default range, compared with CP2 proposals,charges are still higher than under the present rules. For example, a banklending to an SME with a 2% probability of default would now have to setaside 10.3% of the capital, compared with 15.4% under the January proposals.Collateral mitigation could reduce this to 9.3%, and receivables mitigationmight further reduce the amount to 8.3%.But Hofmann believes this risk-weighting curve does not go far enough. ""Whenyou look at the curve, the typical probability of default range for an SME,which is around 2%, still triggers a capital charge of above 10% - 2percentage points above the current treatment,"" he says. This will translateinto the pricing of these loans. ""How big will the interest rate effect beon SMEs? According to our calculations it is still significant,"" Hofmannsays.As a result, the Bank of Italy and the Deutsche Bundesbank drafted aconfidential joint paper, released October 19, which was submitted to theCommittee's working group on overall capital. The paper proposes that afunction based on the relationship between asset correlation and size shouldbe added to the IRB risk-weight curve methodology based on the relationshipbetween asset correlation and probability of default. The paper,'Calibration of benchmark risk weights in the IRB approach to regulatorycapital requirements', contends that joint treatment of probability ofdefault and a firm-size effects on asset correlation could produce a riskweighting function that addresses both procyclicality issues produced by thenew framework and concerns related to the treatment of lending to SMEs. TheCommittee is now investigating the matter as part of an additionalquantitative impact study, QIS 2.5.But many banks, including German financial institutions, are stronglyopposed to the introduction of additional parameters, such as number ofemployees, assets and turnover functions into the risk-weighting curve. Theysee a size function as an unnecessary complication. ""Segmentation on thegrounds of turnover is unsatisfactory to us. Retail businesses and wholesalebusinesses may have similar turnover, but the characteristics and the wayyou would manage them in risk terms would be quite different,"" says ColinJennings, senior manager, non-retail related risk at Lloyds TSB, the UK'sthird largest bank. ""If that was imposed on us we would have to change oursystems considerably to do what we think would achieve no real benefit,""adds Simon Baker, Lloyds TSB's head of risk policy, overseeing about ?6billion in commercial portfolios (above ?2 million in turnover) and an equalamount in small business portfolios, plus retail loans to its 16 millionretail customers base.Further effectsBankers are also opposed to another key aspect of Basel II that affects SMElending. The Committee believes banks should put aside capital for expectedlosses in addition to the current practice of making capital charges againstunexpected losses - credit risk. From a theoretical view of capital, suchrequirements should be fulfilled by future margin income and not byregulatory capital allocations. The Germans favour this 'pure' approach.""Expected losses are covered by future margin income. We don't need anydouble counting by using regulatory capital to cover expected losses,"" saysa German banker.Although Basel has made some concessions in this area, saying it would scrapexpected loss provisions for retail loans - excluding mortgages - and allowdeductions from special and general loan loss reserves against expectedlosses, the Committee's 'inelegant solution' has again run into Germanopposition. ""The German Ministry of Finance restricts the amount ofloan-loss reserves due to fears that banks would attempt to reduce theirincome figures to avoid tax payments,"" says one German banker. ""We fear thatthis could lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage forGerman banks because of tax regulations, so we are very much againstcovering expected losses with regulatory capital.""A potential solution is to include expected losses under Pillar II of BaselII, leaving it up to the discretion of national supervisors to ensureexpected losses are fully covered, while ensuring a level playing fieldamong nations. But some claim the Committee is unconvinced that expectedlosses are fully accounted for by national regulators in specific productareas or nations like Japan, and have pushed for specific Pillar I treatmentto alleviate their concerns. ""The current envisioned compromise is that thiswill not be done across the board. While it is not an elegant solution, itaddresses the most important substantive concerns the industry has raisedabout the inclusion of expected loss,"" says a Basel Committee member.The strong German opposition to so many SME-related treatments will make aspeedy resolution difficult, with much said to be hinging on sidelinediscussions between the German and American contingents ahead of the CapitalTask Force and Basel Committee meetings, scheduled for December 6 and 7 inNew York, and the December 12 and 13 in Basel, respectively. With the timingtight in terms of enshrining a European Directive in European Union andEuropean national legislation, the industry needs a major breakthrough basedon sound banking supervision practices, rather than an appeasement inresponse to political sabre-rattling, which risks weighing down the entireBasel II process.ISDA and FpML.org to mergeRisk - December 2001By Rob Dwyer The International Swaps and Derivatives Association plans to integrateFpML.org the not-for-profit company set up to develop Financial productsMarkup Language (FpML) - into its organisational structure by the end of theyear. The merger of the two organisations is aimed at facilitating thedevelopment of FpML by allowing FpML.orgs members to concentrate ontechnical issues.Mart Meinel, co-chair of FpML's standards committee and head of fixed-incomeIT at UBS Warburg, says becoming part of ISDA will remove the burden ofadministration from the technical team. We will be able to use ISDAresources which will speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and thedevelopment of version 3.0,' he says. 'The standards committee ended updoing a lot of the administration work to run the FpML symposiums, and wehope to leverage off ISDA conferences (for future symposiums).""FpML based on the flexible extensible markup language' (XML), is designed tocreate an industry standard for electronic trading. FpML 1.0, launched inJuly 2000, covers interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.  FpML ispresently working on version 2.0, which will include swaptions, caps,floors, collars and straddles, as well as several other instruments, as wellas those covered in 1.0.  Implementation is slated for the end of December.The committee is also planning to publish a draft of 3.0, which will extendFpML coverage to foreign exchange and equity derivatives, by the end of thisyear.Meinel says FpML's integration with ISDA was part of the standardscommittee's strategy from the organisation's inception. 'Since we have beenworking on ISDA documentation then converting that into XML, our work has anatural fit with ISDA,"" says Meinel, Operating from inside ISDA will helpthe development of FpML be better aligned with the documentation of newproducts as it comes along.""StrainRobert Pickel, ISDA's chief executive officer, says the merger will allowmembers of FpML to focus on technical development. But will it prove astrain on often-stretched ISDA resources? We envision adding some extrastaff, and we project that we will be able to find the extra funding neededthrough due-based revenues' says Pickel. ""As a volunteer organization, itwas an issue for FpML members to find time aside from their day jobs. Andyet they have still managed to establish FpML as a brand that is the basisfor OTC derivatives transactions in the future,"" he adds.FpML users welcomed the announcement.  Mark Brickell, chief executiveofficer of online swaps trading platform Blackbird, and chairman of lSDAbetween 1988 and 1992, says: ""We actively encouraged ISDA to take on thisproject.  Creating FpML is as important as the ISDA Master Swap Agreement,because it will strengthen the framework for the swap negotiation.""Brickell says Blackbird was the first company to offer FpML confirmations toits customers, and he believes ISDA will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 andexpand FpML further to cover more kinds of transactions more quickly.Observers say the success of the project depends on recruiting. An officialat an FpML-affiliated company says: ""ISDA hasn't had this level oftechnology project before, so the key will he whether it hires someone withthe requisite level of technological expertise."" ISDA officials say detailsabout FpML recruitment have yet to be finalised.**End of ISDA Press Report for December 27, 2001**THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'SBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

A spanner in the works 
Risk - December 2001

When the Basel Committee issued its second consultative document proposals
(CP2) for a new regulatory capital Accord in January, it prompted fierce
opposition from banks, academics and lobbying groups over its treatment of
loans to small- to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This sector is the
backbone and growth engine of many major economies. Now, nearly a year
later, the issue has come to a head. The US and Germany - which is fiercely
protective of its SME sector, the mittelstand - are engaged in brinkmanship
over the capital treatment of loans to SMEs that could cause the entire
Basel II capital Accord to unravel.

SME lenders' initial concerns included the steepness of Basel's credit risk
weighting curve for the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, its
insistence that expected loss provisions should be made in addition to
typical unexpected loss provisions, confusion over which SME loans could be
included under the retail approach, and the extent to which physical
collateral could be used as a risk mitigant. The Committee has moved to
address many of these concerns, although some, like the risk weighting
curve, remain prickly. But a critical issue, the use of maturity adjustments
in the calculation of capital charges for corporate and SME lending, which
requires banks to put aside more capital for longer-dated loans, is far from
being settled.

The German banking industry in particular is worried that overly harsh SME
treatment would push up lending costs, thereby stifling capital to a vital
source of the country's economic growth. While German banks have several
concerns, the country's lack of flexibility on the maturity issue threatens
to derail the entire Basel II process, which in turn would throw the
European Directive based on Basel II into disarray.

While most Basel lobbying has been carried out via traditional banking
channels - with national banking associations petitioning their regulators
that sit on the Basel Committee and its working groups - the debate in
Germany, Europe's largest economy, involves the highest levels of
government. German chancellor Gerhard Schr?der and economics minister Werner
M?ller said in late October that German funding to the mittelstand must not
be impaired by Basel II. ""Basel II is not acceptable to Germany in its
present form. Everyone must reckon with our opposition to a European Union
guideline based on Basel II,"" said Schr?der, referring specifically to
treatment of SMEs.

The Basel Committee has since issued a paper, 'Potential modifications to
the Committee's proposals', which outlines current thinking within the
Committee and indicates that it will make key concessions to SME lenders.

The most important aspect of the paper, released November 5, is the
Committee's move to lower and flatten the IRB risk weighting capital curve -
which is a function of a firm's probability of default. This significantly
lowers capital requirements for SME lending. The move is based on evidence
that small companies are less likely than large corporates to default during
economic downturns.

But the paper failed to touch on the maturity debate. ""[It] says nothing
about maturity, just about the risk weights without any maturity
adjustments,"" says Tobias Winkler, head of international banking issues in
the department for banking supervision at the Bundesverband deutscher Banken
(Association of German Commercial Banks). ""This a right step, but certain
additional things have to be done to take account of special circumstances
of SME lending [in Germany],"" he adds. ""The maturity adjustment has to be
abolished in the advanced approach,"" he argues.

The German side claims the terms of loans to the mittelstand are
significantly longer than those to their SME counterparts in the US or the
UK.

""We have got very long maturities, this would put German banks at an
enormous competitive disadvantage compared with other countries,"" says
Winkler.

Evidence to support this argument is hard to come by, especially since the
Basel Committee refuses to disclose cross-country comparisons for factors
like average loan maturities from its second quantitative impact study (QIS
2). But several officials with access to QIS 2 data say the average maturity
of loans made by domestic financial institutions to businesses in Germany is
4.28 years, a figure that falls to 2.95 years for Germany's internationally
active banks. Average maturities for business loans in other G-10 countries
were said to lie between two and 2.5 years. 

The CP2 proposals for Basel II contained two maturity approaches in IRB
treatment, one called the 'default model', ironically said to be a German
proposal, and the other a US 'mark-to-market' approach strongly backed by
the British. Under these two approaches, it is assumed that the risk of
default on a loan is higher if it is longer-dated, an assertion that has
been supported by several studies of historic data. The 'mark-to-market'
approach also takes into account the economic deterioration of the position
and not just final default. This Anglo model heavily penalises longer-term
loans. According to the Zentraler Kreditausschus (ZKA), a central banking
association which represents the interests of German commercial banks,
savings banks, regional state banks and co-operatives, long-term exposures
of seven years could require up to six times as much capital as one year
exposures - although one German banking official said a cap had now been
placed on maturities at five years, reducing this figure to 400%. ""Capital
add-ons for long-term loans would therefore seriously affect the
international competitiveness of the German banking industry and result in
higher interest rates for borrowers that would not be justified by the risk
exposure,"" said the ZKA in a statement during the comment period.

But Germany stands virtually alone in its refusal to accept the US-led
maturity proposals. ""The data analysed by the Committee clearly shows that
you have these upward-sloping curves for maturities. What kills a bank is
deterioration of value, and it has got to provide for a lot of things on the
books, so you can't wait for final default,"" said a Basel Committee member.
""But you can argue about the steepness, and that is a matter for debate.""
The fact that Germany's other key allies in the wider SME debate - namely
Japan, Italy and Spain - are in favour of maturity adjustments, has prompted
a number of non-German regulators, albeit veiled behind the protection of
anonymity, to play down the importance of the maturity impasse to Basel II's
implementation. But such views fail to take into account the depth of
feeling that German banks, banking associations, the Bundesbank, parliament
and the general public have in protecting funding to the mittlestand. This
unusual level of pressure has left the German negotiators with very little
room for manoeuvre.

Gerhard Hofmann, director of banking supervision at the Deutsche Bundesbank,
was one of the few regulators prepared to speak publicly on the issue. He
said his hands were all but tied on the maturity debate, and confirmed that
the German side would be prepared to scupper Basel II's timetable should a
deal fail to be reached. ""If this does not come to an end, then the European
effort will be postponed too. I have difficulties imagining that we would
introduce Basel II in Europe and not have a level playing field on a G-10
basis."" While Hofmann said the matter was ""very serious"", he remained
confident that all sides could reach a solution.
 
Compromise
Risk was told by one European banking representative who claims to be
closely involved in the talks that a current compromise suggestion is to
halve the US mark-to-market maturity adjustments. This would mean the 600%
figure mentioned in the ZKA paper for a 'AAA'-rated, seven-year loan would
be reduced to 200%. But a US representative distanced himself from this
being a US proposal. ""I would not describe the negotiating position that
way,"" he said. Asked if the US team would agree such a concession, he added,
""I couldn't say that we would, but it would depend on the whole package.
Fifty per cent on the mark-to-market adjustment seems an obvious point to
try and compromise on, but I'm not sure the US side would agree to that.""

Hofmann was also cautious, saying ""I would rather hesitate to comment on
that, but yes, it is a direction we are heading. This is a critical point
and I hesitate to comment in public because we are in the midst of this
rather difficult negotiating process and I really don't want to jeopardise
anything. It will be quite tough.""  While almost every country that supports
maturity adjustments believes a 50% mark-down would be an acceptable
compromise, Germany may still hold out. Another German bank executive says
it may find a 50% mark-down unsatisfactory.

Another area of potential compromise is to allow banks with loan maturities
of less than three years to gain a downward capital allocation adjustment,
while banks with loans of more than three years would be capped at the
three-year level - as factored into the current proposed standardised credit
approach. 

But German bankers appear set to resist even this level of compromise,
claiming that German internationally active banks (with average maturities
of 2.95 years) would be on an unfair playing field with other
internationally active banks, which have average maturities closer to the
two years. But German banking officials could not come up with hard data to
support the claims.

While maturity is the largest single SME-related issue for the Basel
Committee to resolve, there are a number of other matters that also need
clearing up, and, once again, the Germans are digging in their heels. For
example, the IRB credit risk-weighting curve proposed by the Committee on
November 5 fails to completely assuage concern about higher SME lending
charges. While Basel's current approach would mean that banks would have to
set aside significantly less capital against SMEs, which typically fall in
the 1% to 3% probability of default range, compared with CP2 proposals,
charges are still higher than under the present rules. For example, a bank
lending to an SME with a 2% probability of default would now have to set
aside 10.3% of the capital, compared with 15.4% under the January proposals.

Collateral mitigation could reduce this to 9.3%, and receivables mitigation
might further reduce the amount to 8.3%.

But Hofmann believes this risk-weighting curve does not go far enough. ""When
you look at the curve, the typical probability of default range for an SME,
which is around 2%, still triggers a capital charge of above 10% - 2
percentage points above the current treatment,"" he says. This will translate
into the pricing of these loans. ""How big will the interest rate effect be
on SMEs? According to our calculations it is still significant,"" Hofmann
says.

As a result, the Bank of Italy and the Deutsche Bundesbank drafted a
confidential joint paper, released October 19, which was submitted to the
Committee's working group on overall capital. The paper proposes that a
function based on the relationship between asset correlation and size should
be added to the IRB risk-weight curve methodology based on the relationship
between asset correlation and probability of default. The paper,
'Calibration of benchmark risk weights in the IRB approach to regulatory
capital requirements', contends that joint treatment of probability of
default and a firm-size effects on asset correlation could produce a risk
weighting function that addresses both procyclicality issues produced by the
new framework and concerns related to the treatment of lending to SMEs. The
Committee is now investigating the matter as part of an additional
quantitative impact study, QIS 2.5.

But many banks, including German financial institutions, are strongly
opposed to the introduction of additional parameters, such as number of
employees, assets and turnover functions into the risk-weighting curve. They
see a size function as an unnecessary complication. ""Segmentation on the
grounds of turnover is unsatisfactory to us. Retail businesses and wholesale
businesses may have similar turnover, but the characteristics and the way
you would manage them in risk terms would be quite different,"" says Colin
Jennings, senior manager, non-retail related risk at Lloyds TSB, the UK's
third largest bank. ""If that was imposed on us we would have to change our
systems considerably to do what we think would achieve no real benefit,""
adds Simon Baker, Lloyds TSB's head of risk policy, overseeing about ?6
billion in commercial portfolios (above ?2 million in turnover) and an equal
amount in small business portfolios, plus retail loans to its 16 million
retail customers base.

Further effects
Bankers are also opposed to another key aspect of Basel II that affects SME
lending. The Committee believes banks should put aside capital for expected
losses in addition to the current practice of making capital charges against
unexpected losses - credit risk. From a theoretical view of capital, such
requirements should be fulfilled by future margin income and not by
regulatory capital allocations. The Germans favour this 'pure' approach.

""Expected losses are covered by future margin income. We don't need any
double counting by using regulatory capital to cover expected losses,"" says
a German banker.

Although Basel has made some concessions in this area, saying it would scrap
expected loss provisions for retail loans - excluding mortgages - and allow
deductions from special and general loan loss reserves against expected
losses, the Committee's 'inelegant solution' has again run into German
opposition. ""The German Ministry of Finance restricts the amount of
loan-loss reserves due to fears that banks would attempt to reduce their
income figures to avoid tax payments,"" says one German banker. ""We fear that
this could lead to a severe international competitive disadvantage for
German banks because of tax regulations, so we are very much against
covering expected losses with regulatory capital.""

A potential solution is to include expected losses under Pillar II of Basel
II, leaving it up to the discretion of national supervisors to ensure
expected losses are fully covered, while ensuring a level playing field
among nations. But some claim the Committee is unconvinced that expected
losses are fully accounted for by national regulators in specific product
areas or nations like Japan, and have pushed for specific Pillar I treatment
to alleviate their concerns. ""The current envisioned compromise is that this
will not be done across the board. While it is not an elegant solution, it
addresses the most important substantive concerns the industry has raised
about the inclusion of expected loss,"" says a Basel Committee member.

The strong German opposition to so many SME-related treatments will make a
speedy resolution difficult, with much said to be hinging on sideline
discussions between the German and American contingents ahead of the Capital
Task Force and Basel Committee meetings, scheduled for December 6 and 7 in
New York, and the December 12 and 13 in Basel, respectively. With the timing
tight in terms of enshrining a European Directive in European Union and
European national legislation, the industry needs a major breakthrough based
on sound banking supervision practices, rather than an appeasement in
response to political sabre-rattling, which risks weighing down the entire
Basel II process.

ISDA and FpML.org to merge
Risk - December 2001
By Rob Dwyer
 
The International Swaps and Derivatives Association plans to integrate
FpML.org the not-for-profit company set up to develop Financial products
Markup Language (FpML) - into its organisational structure by the end of the
year. The merger of the two organisations is aimed at facilitating the
development of FpML by allowing FpML.orgs members to concentrate on
technical issues.

Mart Meinel, co-chair of FpML's standards committee and head of fixed-income
IT at UBS Warburg, says becoming part of ISDA will remove the burden of
administration from the technical team. We will be able to use ISDA
resources which will speed up the implementation of version 2.0 and the
development of version 3.0,' he says. 'The standards committee ended up
doing a lot of the administration work to run the FpML symposiums, and we
hope to leverage off ISDA conferences (for future symposiums).""

FpML based on the flexible extensible markup language' (XML), is designed to
create an industry standard for electronic trading. FpML 1.0, launched in
July 2000, covers interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.  FpML is
presently working on version 2.0, which will include swaptions, caps,
floors, collars and straddles, as well as several other instruments, as well
as those covered in 1.0.  Implementation is slated for the end of December.
The committee is also planning to publish a draft of 3.0, which will extend
FpML coverage to foreign exchange and equity derivatives, by the end of this
year.

Meinel says FpML's integration with ISDA was part of the standards
committee's strategy from the organisation's inception. 'Since we have been
working on ISDA documentation then converting that into XML, our work has a
natural fit with ISDA,"" says Meinel, Operating from inside ISDA will help
the development of FpML be better aligned with the documentation of new
products as it comes along.""

Strain
Robert Pickel, ISDA's chief executive officer, says the merger will allow
members of FpML to focus on technical development. But will it prove a
strain on often-stretched ISDA resources? We envision adding some extra
staff, and we project that we will be able to find the extra funding needed
through due-based revenues' says Pickel. ""As a volunteer organization, it
was an issue for FpML members to find time aside from their day jobs. And
yet they have still managed to establish FpML as a brand that is the basis
for OTC derivatives transactions in the future,"" he adds.

FpML users welcomed the announcement.  Mark Brickell, chief executive
officer of online swaps trading platform Blackbird, and chairman of lSDA
between 1988 and 1992, says: ""We actively encouraged ISDA to take on this
project.  Creating FpML is as important as the ISDA Master Swap Agreement,
because it will strengthen the framework for the swap negotiation.""
Brickell says Blackbird was the first company to offer FpML confirmations to
its customers, and he believes ISDA will accelerate the adoption of 2.0 and
expand FpML further to cover more kinds of transactions more quickly.

Observers say the success of the project depends on recruiting. An official
at an FpML-affiliated company says: ""ISDA hasn't had this level of
technology project before, so the key will he whether it hires someone with
the requisite level of technological expertise."" ISDA officials say details
about FpML recruitment have yet to be finalised.

Swaps contracts aregenerally used by large institutions to hedge risk, such as interest-raterisk or currency risk.Retail swaps involve customers who are not ""eligible contract participants""under federal law. This group includes individuals who have less than $10million in assets, or less than $5 million under certain conditions, as wellas non-financial entities that have total assets of less than $10 millionand do not use swaps as a normal part of their business.Retail swaps are not covered under recent legislation that regulatesderivatives. The study released Thursday surveyed representatives fromdealers, a derivatives trading system and a trade association.The joint report said that the four agencies do not currently see a need toregulate most swaps involving these small customers, with the ""possibleexception"" of energy swaps. Should regulators see a need to oversee energyswaps, current legislation appears to give the CFTC some latitude to act,the report said.If interest in energy swaps were to outpace the current scope of the CFTC'sauthority, Congress might wish to step in at that time, the report said.2001: A Derivatives OdysseyFOW - December 2001The derivatives industry in 2001 has experienced continued consolidationamong users and exchanges. Electronic trading practices have furtherpenetrated into traditional procedures, while exchanges have reaped healthyrevenues from derivative contracts.One product that has swept across the world's derivatives exchanges thisyear is the single stock future. London International Financial Futures andOptions Exchange (Liffe) launched its Universal Stock Futures in January2001, to great fanfare but only moderate success. Nevertheless, exchanges inEurope and Asia rushed to jump on the single stock bandwagon. Anxious not tomiss out on the action, the US repealed the Shad-Johnson accord, in placesince 1982, which prevented investors betting on the future price ofindividual stocks. The repeal was set to become effective on 21 December,but has since been postponed to the end of March 2002. Bill Rainer, who waschairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at thetime of the repeal, notes that while the bill is generally sound, it isstill within the period of industry comment.Rainer has since moved on and is currently heading one of the newest singlestock ventures, between Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT), Chicago MercantileExchange (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This remarkablealliance pools the resources and liquidity of the three exchanges, givingserious competition to American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the joint offeringbetween Liffe and Nasdaq. While the single stock futures will be offered toalt qualified market participants, Rainer feels the product will not besuited to all sectors of the market. ""They are likely to be more attractiveto the institutional sector than the individual sector because institutionshave the resources to educate themselves about the value of the product andits place in their strategies,"" he explains. Nevertheless, he is confidentin the product's value as a useful risk management tool for anypractitioner. However, confidence in single stocks is far from unanimous.Not withstanding the hype, dissenters note that the volumes in single stocksare subdued around the world. The start of trading in the US may give them amuch-needed boost but, as yet, the money is going elsewhere.""The evolution of the index derivative product business has been the mostsignificant development in 2001,"" says Uwe Velten, at European derivativesexchange, Eurex, and he thinks it will continue. ""This is just the beginningof a strong product group. Index products are one of the most intelligenttools to manage risk with,"" he assures. ""As they are a trend in the market,we encourage them in our portfolio."" Velten notes that the importance ofindex products has increased with their expanding geographical scope. ""Foryears, futures and options on the Dax was our only index product. Then weexpanded our product offering beyond national products."" ParisBourse, SwissExchange, Deutsche Bourse and Dow Jones created Stoxx in early 1998 toprovide a European-wide family of indices. ""When Eurex was created, wecaptured all euro Stoxx business, and today we average around 220,000contracts a day, and this is growing,""Velten explains. ""Now we have moved into global offerings, with Nymex 50futures and options and sector index products from Dow Jones, which aregrowing from a small base. This is what the future will bring. The businessis growing in Europe with sector index products and, globally, with the newGlobal Titans products."" Eurex has experienced 80% growth in index productsthis year, compared with 250/0 growth in capital market products and thefixed income sector, and 500/0 growth in stock options.  Eurex's five-yearGerman government bond (Bobl) contract was the fixed-income headline grabberof 2001. When one market player successfully manufactured a bobl squeeze inMarch by cornering the market in the physically deliverable futurescontracts, Eurex needed to act fast to avoid a repeat performance inSeptember. In an overhaul of its securities regulations, the exchangeintroduced position limits on the futures contracts and, crucially,rectified the discrepancy in penalty charges for the late delivery ofunderlying securities with drastic cuts. The fixed income community offeredonly timid approval however, and few believed a squeeze could be fullyavoided.Sensing opportunity in the air Euronext Paris re-launched its five-yearEuropean government bond futures contact in a bid to capture market sharefrom disenchanted Bobl traders. A deal between Eurex and the German financeagency Bundesfinanz Agentur finally stretched the September Bobl, with anagreement to supply additional bonds in case of another shortage. Byextending the pool of deliverable securities the Bobl looks set for an easyride this December. However, the long-term future of government debt marketsin general still hangs in the balance.Both sides of the Atlantic have suffered a dearth of government bonds amidtreasury buy-back programmes and cuts in issuance this year. Most recently,the US Treasury stopped issuing 30-year bonds in November. Subsequently,investors have begun to favour the swaps market to hedge their interest raterisk. Many market sources and the Bank for International Settlements claimthat interest rate swaps are the leading candidate to replace governmentsecurities as the leading capital market's benchmark. In March, as thefragmented government bond market continued to shrink amid high-profilecontract squeezes, Liffe entered the fray, hoping to mop up business with afamily of euro-denominated futures on interest rate swaps, collectivelynamed Swapnote. Contrary to the many doubts over the product's ability tocapture liquidity from the OTC market, it attracted substantial interest.The success of the contract in Europe convinced Liffe to make plans forexpansion into the US market with the euro-denominated swap futures, withspeculation of a US dollar swap contract to follow.Witnessing the success of Swapnote, and conscious of its faltering T-bondfuture, CBoT introduced a suite of swaps derivatives that made a promisingdebut in November. Nicholas Neubauer, chairman at CBoT, explains theconcerns underlying the decision. ""Earlier this year, there was a feelingthat the amount of publicly available Federal debt would decline to zeroover the next five to ten years. We, therefore, wanted to offer ourcustomers a swap contract as an alternative tool."" While these new swapcontracts have proved highly popular, they must be seen in perspective - forexample, while Liffe's daily average for Swapnote is around 20,000contracts, Eurex's ten-year bond averages nearer 500,000. Nevertheless, itis a product class with great potential. As Neubauer says: ""If it is goingto be a winner, it will be a big winner.""Volumes in the options market have been thriving in 2001. A single dayrecord of 2.7m was notched by CBOE in April, which is now in competitionwith five other options exchanges in the US. ""We are very pleased with thisyear's performance, especially in light of the increased competition, bothdomestically and internationally,"" says Edward Provost, executive vp atCBOE. However, all has not been plain sailing, and the options market hassuffered upheaval with the move to decimalisation. ""In the case of options,this change required a substantial technological effort to trade decimalsinstead of fractions,"" comments Provost. ""It also has a significant impacton the way options traders operate, even more than on the stock side."" Themove to modernity was sanctioned because a stock price quoted in fractionsforces an artificially wide spread. But while decimalisation allows for manymore potential price points for a stock, it subsequently creates anamplification of complexity for options pricing. ""This increased capacityfor market quotation results in an increased number of market floatationupdates,"" explains Provost. ""So it was all about operational preparedness,and adapting systems for a surge in business. For CBOE, the change todecimals went very smoothly.""Electronic tradingTechnological upheaval has affected many derivatives exchanges in 2001 andthe troubles at CBoT have been symptomatic of the industry as a whole. ""Bythe end of 2000 there was a great deal of doom and gloom on the tradingfloor about the impact of electronic trading,"" says Nicholas Neubauer. ""Ourbusiness model of open-outcry trading was being slated for early extinctionin favour of electronic matching engines."" On top of this, he explains,plans to become a for-profit organisation were seen as simplistic and causedtwo lawsuits with the CBOE. In addition, the ceo of 20 years left. Havingset forth a programme of ten promises, including modifying the restructuringplan, hiring a high quality ceo, and settling the law suits, Neubauer hasnow put the exchange back on track.Meanwhile, Ace, the electronic trading joint venture between CBoT and Eurex,has been the subject of much wrangling over maintenance responsibilities.However, the platform averages around 20,000 contracts a day, accounting forroughly 230/0 of business. ""Generally we have found that, on volatile days,people use open-outcry and, on slow days, Ace increases its market share,""explains Neubauer. ""During volatile periods, traders get more informationout of a central marketplace than the more sterile environment of screentrading."" After the heartache that electronic trading and Ace in particularcaused, it was Ace's performance that fuelled the exchange's return toprofit in September.  Teething problems with new electronic trading systemshave been rife among many derivatives exchanges this year. As CBoT and Eurexfeuded over Ace, London Metal Exchange saw a lacklustre response to Select,picking up slightly after a phase two launch in October, and New YorkMercantile Exchange argued with the providers of Enymex.However, Liffe's Connect system has been the key to the revival of itsfortunes. After a few false starts, Connect has quickly gained acclaim forits superior matching and distribution capabilities. Liffe won its firstmajor deal with Nasdaq to list futures on single stocks on Connect. Then, inJuly, Liffe agreed to provide Connect products and services to TokyoFinancial Futures and Options Exchange (Tiffe). In an alliance similar toAce, the Connect link allows Tiffe and Liffe members to trade on oneanother's exchanges. It was Liffe's aptitude with derivative technology thatplaced the company on a firm footing for November's merger. In October, CBOE launched CBOEdirect, to a modest reception. The system willoperate in pre-trade hours, initially with options on the Dow JonesIndustrial Index. CBOE's Provost explains that a feature of the system isunderscoring the world's altered preoccupations. ""One benefit of beginningto use screen-based trading is that it is a very logical and viable disasterrecovery trading system. This is something we, and other exchanges, arelooking at.""Of course, any retrospective on 2001 would not be complete without mentionof the World Trade Centre tragedy. During this terrible time, the financialcommunity came together with firm resolve, to help colleagues andcompetitors alike, in an unprecedented show of solidarity. There was adefiant determination to keep financial markets functioning as close tonormality as possible throughout the terrible ordeal, and in memory of thosewho died.**End of ISDA Press Report for December 28, 2001**THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'SBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

US Fed, Treasury, SEC, CFTC Survey Recommends No New Swaps Law
Dow Jones - December 28, 2001
By Rebecca Christie

WASHINGTON -- U.S. financial market regulators recommended no new
legislation to regulate swap agreements involving customers with low net
worth, according to a study released Thursday by four federal agencies.

The U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a joint report
on ""retail swaps"" Thursday assessing whether there was a need for further
regulation.

A swap is a type of financial transaction in which two parties agree to
exchange payments or securities over a period of time. Swaps contracts are
generally used by large institutions to hedge risk, such as interest-rate
risk or currency risk.

Retail swaps involve customers who are not ""eligible contract participants""
under federal law. This group includes individuals who have less than $10
million in assets, or less than $5 million under certain conditions, as well
as non-financial entities that have total assets of less than $10 million
and do not use swaps as a normal part of their business.

Retail swaps are not covered under recent legislation that regulates
derivatives. The study released Thursday surveyed representatives from
dealers, a derivatives trading system and a trade association.

The joint report said that the four agencies do not currently see a need to
regulate most swaps involving these small customers, with the ""possible
exception"" of energy swaps. Should regulators see a need to oversee energy
swaps, current legislation appears to give the CFTC some latitude to act,
the report said.

If interest in energy swaps were to outpace the current scope of the CFTC's
authority, Congress might wish to step in at that time, the report said.

2001: A Derivatives Odyssey
FOW - December 2001

The derivatives industry in 2001 has experienced continued consolidation
among users and exchanges. Electronic trading practices have further
penetrated into traditional procedures, while exchanges have reaped healthy
revenues from derivative contracts.

One product that has swept across the world's derivatives exchanges this
year is the single stock future. London International Financial Futures and
Options Exchange (Liffe) launched its Universal Stock Futures in January
2001, to great fanfare but only moderate success. Nevertheless, exchanges in
Europe and Asia rushed to jump on the single stock bandwagon. Anxious not to
miss out on the action, the US repealed the Shad-Johnson accord, in place
since 1982, which prevented investors betting on the future price of
individual stocks. The repeal was set to become effective on 21 December,
but has since been postponed to the end of March 2002. Bill Rainer, who was
chairman of the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) at the
time of the repeal, notes that while the bill is generally sound, it is
still within the period of industry comment.

Rainer has since moved on and is currently heading one of the newest single
stock ventures, between Chicago Board of Trade (CBoT), Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). This remarkable
alliance pools the resources and liquidity of the three exchanges, giving
serious competition to American Stock Exchange (Amex) and the joint offering
between Liffe and Nasdaq. While the single stock futures will be offered to
alt qualified market participants, Rainer feels the product will not be
suited to all sectors of the market. ""They are likely to be more attractive
to the institutional sector than the individual sector because institutions
have the resources to educate themselves about the value of the product and
its place in their strategies,"" he explains. Nevertheless, he is confident
in the product's value as a useful risk management tool for any
practitioner. However, confidence in single stocks is far from unanimous.
Not withstanding the hype, dissenters note that the volumes in single stocks
are subdued around the world. The start of trading in the US may give them a
much-needed boost but, as yet, the money is going elsewhere.

""The evolution of the index derivative product business has been the most
significant development in 2001,"" says Uwe Velten, at European derivatives
exchange, Eurex, and he thinks it will continue. ""This is just the beginning
of a strong product group. Index products are one of the most intelligent
tools to manage risk with,"" he assures. ""As they are a trend in the market,
we encourage them in our portfolio."" Velten notes that the importance of
index products has increased with their expanding geographical scope. ""For
years, futures and options on the Dax was our only index product. Then we
expanded our product offering beyond national products."" ParisBourse, Swiss
Exchange, Deutsche Bourse and Dow Jones created Stoxx in early 1998 to
provide a European-wide family of indices. ""When Eurex was created, we
captured all euro Stoxx business, and today we average around 220,000
contracts a day, and this is growing,""

Velten explains. ""Now we have moved into global offerings, with Nymex 50
futures and options and sector index products from Dow Jones, which are
growing from a small base. This is what the future will bring. The business
is growing in Europe with sector index products and, globally, with the new
Global Titans products."" Eurex has experienced 80% growth in index products
this year, compared with 250/0 growth in capital market products and the
fixed income sector, and 500/0 growth in stock options.  Eurex's five-year
German government bond (Bobl) contract was the fixed-income headline grabber
of 2001. When one market player successfully manufactured a bobl squeeze in
March by cornering the market in the physically deliverable futures
contracts, Eurex needed to act fast to avoid a repeat performance in
September. In an overhaul of its securities regulations, the exchange
introduced position limits on the futures contracts and, crucially,
rectified the discrepancy in penalty charges for the late delivery of
underlying securities with drastic cuts. The fixed income community offered
only timid approval however, and few believed a squeeze could be fully
avoided.

Sensing opportunity in the air Euronext Paris re-launched its five-year
European government bond futures contact in a bid to capture market share
from disenchanted Bobl traders. A deal between Eurex and the German finance
agency Bundesfinanz Agentur finally stretched the September Bobl, with an
agreement to supply additional bonds in case of another shortage. By
extending the pool of deliverable securities the Bobl looks set for an easy
ride this December. However, the long-term future of government debt markets
in general still hangs in the balance.

Both sides of the Atlantic have suffered a dearth of government bonds amid
treasury buy-back programmes and cuts in issuance this year. Most recently,
the US Treasury stopped issuing 30-year bonds in November. Subsequently,
investors have begun to favour the swaps market to hedge their interest rate

that interest rate swaps are the leading candidate to replace government
securities as the leading capital market's benchmark. In March, as the
fragmented government bond market continued to shrink amid high-profile

family of euro-denominated futures on interest rate swaps, collectively
named Swapnote. Contrary to the many doubts over the product's ability to
capture liquidity from the OTC market, it attracted substantial interest.
The success of the contract in Europe convinced Liffe to make plans for
expansion into the US market with the euro-denominated swap futures, with
speculation of a US dollar swap contract to follow.

Witnessing the success of Swapnote, and conscious of its faltering T-bond
future, CBoT introduced a suite of swaps derivatives that made a promising
debut in November. Nicholas Neubauer, chairman at CBoT, explains the
concerns underlying the decision. ""Earlier this year, there was a feeling
that the amount of publicly available Federal debt would decline to zero
over the next five to ten years. We, therefore, wanted to offer our
customers a swap contract as an alternative tool."" While these new swap
contracts have proved highly popular, they must be seen in perspective - for
example, while Liffe's daily average for Swapnote is around 20,000
contracts, Eurex's ten-year bond averages nearer 500,000. Nevertheless, it
is a product class with great potential. As Neubauer says: ""If it is going
to be a winner, it will be a big winner.""

Volumes in the options market have been thriving in 2001. A single day
record of 2.7m was notched by CBOE in April, which is now in competition
with five other options exchanges in the US. ""We are very pleased with this

suffered upheaval with the move to decimalisation. ""In the case of options,
this change required a substantial technological effort to trade decimals
instead of fractions,"" comments Provost. ""It also has a significant impact
on the way options traders operate, even more than on the stock side."" The
move to modernity was sanctioned because a stock price quoted in fractions
forces an artificially wide spread. But while decimalisation allows for many
more potential price points for a stock, it subsequently creates an
amplification of complexity for options pricing. ""This increased capacity
for market quotation results in an increased number of market floatation
updates,"" explains Provost. ""So it was all about operational preparedness,
and adapting systems for a surge in business. For CBOE, the change to
decimals went very smoothly.""

Electronic trading
Technological upheaval has affected many derivatives exchanges in 2001 and
the troubles at CBoT have been symptomatic of the industry as a whole. ""By
the end of 2000 there was a great deal of doom and gloom on the trading
floor about the impact of electronic trading,"" says Nicholas Neubauer. ""Our
business model of open-outcry trading was being slated for early extinction
in favour of electronic matching engines."" On top of this, he explains,
plans to become a for-profit organisation were seen as simplistic and caused
two lawsuits with the CBOE. In addition, the ceo of 20 years left. Having
set forth a programme of ten promises, including modifying the restructuring
plan, hiring a high quality ceo, and settling the law suits, Neubauer has
now put the exchange back on track.

Meanwhile, Ace, the electronic trading joint venture between CBoT and Eurex,
has been the subject of much wrangling over maintenance responsibilities.
However, the platform averages around 20,000 contracts a day, accounting for
roughly 230/0 of business. ""Generally we have found that, on volatile days,
people use open-outcry and, on slow days, Ace increases its market share,""
explains Neubauer. ""During volatile periods, traders get more information
out of a central marketplace than the more sterile environment of screen
trading."" After the heartache that electronic trading and Ace in particular
caused, it was Ace's performance that fuelled the exchange's return to
profit in September.  Teething problems with new electronic trading systems
have been rife among many derivatives exchanges this year. As CBoT and Eurex
feuded over Ace, London Metal Exchange saw a lacklustre response to Select,
picking up slightly after a phase two launch in October, and New York
Mercantile Exchange argued with the providers of Enymex.

However, Liffe's Connect system has been the key to the revival of its
fortunes. After a few false starts, Connect has quickly gained acclaim for
its superior matching and distribution capabilities. Liffe won its first
major deal with Nasdaq to list futures on single stocks on Connect. Then, in
July, Liffe agreed to provide Connect products and services to Tokyo
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Tiffe). In an alliance similar to
Ace, the Connect link allows Tiffe and Liffe members to trade on one
another's exchanges. It was Liffe's aptitude with derivative technology that
placed the company on a firm footing for November's merger. 

In October, CBOE launched CBOEdirect, to a modest reception. The system will
operate in pre-trade hours, initially with options on the Dow Jones
Industrial Index. CBOE's Provost explains that a feature of the system is
underscoring the world's altered preoccupations. ""One benefit of beginning
to use screen-based trading is that it is a very logical and viable disaster
recovery trading system. This is something we, and other exchanges, are
looking at.""

Of course, any retrospective on 2001 would not be complete without mention
of the World Trade Centre tragedy. During this terrible time, the financial
community came together with firm resolve, to help colleagues and
competitors alike, in an unprecedented show of solidarity. There was a
defiant determination to keep financial markets functioning as close to
normality as possible throughout the terrible ordeal, and in memory of those
who died.

(NYSE: TXU) and Exelon Generation ann=ounced an agreement to sell two large TXU gas-fired electric generating pla=nts to Exelon Generation, a subsidiary of Exelon Corp. (NYSE: EXC) for $433= million. The transaction, involving two Dallas/Fort Worth plants with a co=mbined capacity of 2,334 MW will allow Exelon Generation to expand its pres=ence in the Texas region, enhancing its geographic and market diversity, wh=ile providing TXU with the opportunity to expand beyond Texas.=20Analysis: Perhaps the key factor about this deal is that it supports the st=rategies of both companies particularly well. TXU, one of the largest gener=ation companies in the world, has been attempting to expand out of its home= state of Texas for some time, following competitive opportunities as they =are presented by electric deregulation. The company, which will maintain a =presence in the Texas market, has already expanded internationally into cou=ntries such as Australia and Europe, and will mostly likely use the proceed=s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni=ted States. For Exelon, the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex=as market, which becomes fully competitive next week, and provides a partic=ularly valuable inroad into the high-demand region of Dallas/Fort Worth.Let's first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is =selling to Exelon. As noted, the combined capacity of the two plants is abo=ut 2,334 MW. One of the plants is the 1,441-MW Handley Steam Electric Stati=on, which is located southeast of Fort Worth. According to TXU, 412,000 bar=rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oil/gas units at the plant. =Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington. The first unit was put into= operation in 1948, with the additional units coming on line in 1950, 1963,= 1976, and 1977. The other plant being sold is the 893-MW Mountain Creek St=eam Electric Station, which is located about two miles west of Loop 12 in D=allas. With the first oil/gas unit established in 1945, four more units wer=e added in 1949, 1956, 1958, and 1967. Both sales include the generating un=its of the plants, along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo=r them to operate (land, water rights, transmission interconnections, gas p=ipeline interconnections, production facilities, and emission allowances).The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr=etty straightforward. From TXU's perspective, the sales will reduce the com=pany's generation concentration in a single U.S. market, which up to this p=oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas. Proceeds from the sale =apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke=ts outside of Texas. In addition, proceeds from the sale will be used to st=rengthen TXU's balance sheet by reducing debt, something that has become in=creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s=pace since the bankruptcy of market-leader Enron. It is important to note t=hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market, and still intends to operate= in the state as a generation company and retailer. Note that according to =Texas restructuring law, there must be a wall between the two operating uni=ts, which must function as separate companies. In essence, the divestiture =is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w=ill support growth into other markets, and reduce the amount of potential m=arket power that the company may have in Texas.=20The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l=atter half of this year, considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene=rgy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have forced several other companies to cha=rge cost-based prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to= hold market power in their particular service territories. Texas law allow=s a company to own and control no more than 20 percent of capacity within t=he Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and TXU claims that it is= within this cap. However, TXU acknowledges that it had an over-concentrati=on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar=kets. Excluding the sold facilities, TXU will now own 18,651 MW of net capa=city, which are still located primarily in Texas. However, it is becoming c=lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market.From Exelon's perspective, the sale expands the company's generating capaci=ty by about 10 percent, which is an important increase considering that Exe=lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industry's largest= asset-based traders. Exelon, which was created as a result of the merger b=etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison, is known mostly for its strong =nuclear capabilities. In fact, Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the =nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, =owning a total of 17 reactors that produce about 17,000 MW of power. Exelon= may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio. Exelo=n Power, which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU, ov=ersees Exelon's portfolio of coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydr=o generating assets, which include 72 intermediate and peaking units in Pen=nsylvania and Maryland (capable of producing 4,800 MW of net generating cap=acity). Thus, Exelon's purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e=ffort to diversify, both regionally and from a power-source perspective, fr=om the company's previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast.=20Perhaps equally important, the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas= market, which represents the second-largest energy market (behind Californ=ia), offering a market value of about $20 billion. Now that California is n=o longer a competitive energy market, there are high hopes that Texas will =prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state =next week. On Jan.1, 2002, most customers of investor-owned utilities in Te=xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP)-th=e company that provides their electricity. As a whole, the Texas energy mar=ket represents 70,000 MW of generation operating on a 37,000-mile transmiss=ion network.=20One of Exelon's main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as=sets and position itself as one of the nation's top-tier energy suppliers. =Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon, which =up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago= to Pennsylvania. This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into= the Texas market. In the summer of 2001, Exelon began operating a new 165-=MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston. Prior =to that, Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from =two other plants in Texas (830 MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and 350 M=W from the Wolf Hollow plant).It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma=rket, especially on the wholesale side of the business, and thus there are =fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract. Unde=r the sales agreement, Exelon Power, Exelon Generation's power plant operat=ion arm, will assume operation of the plants. The transaction includes a to=lling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase powe=r during summer months for the next five years at market-based rates. Consi=dering the standard definition of a tolling agreement, it is presumed that =TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the =summer months of the five-year contract, and then purchasing the electric o=utput of the plants during that time. Interestingly, TXU is able to abide b=y Texas' requirement that it not own and control more than 20 percent withi=n ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants. However, realisti=cally, TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants,= at least in the summer months during its five-year contract with Exelon. T=his raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract be=tween TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas' deregulation pl=an.=20  _____ =20Testimonials:""Let me take this opportunity to wish you a happy holiday as well and to te=ll you how much I appreciate receiving IssueAlert.

rategies of both companies particularly well. TXU, one of the largest gener=

ation companies in the world, has been attempting to expand out of its home=

 state of Texas for some time, following competitive opportunities as they =

are presented by electric deregulation. The company, which will maintain a =

presence in the Texas market, has already expanded internationally into cou=

ntries such as Australia and Europe, and will mostly likely use the proceed=

s from the divestiture of its two Texas plants to expand further in the Uni=

ted States. For Exelon, the deal provides a foothold into the expanding Tex=

as market, which becomes fully competitive next week, and provides a partic=

ularly valuable inroad into the high-demand region of Dallas/Fort Worth.



Let's first establish some important data about the two plants that TXU is =

selling to Exelon. As noted, the combined capacity of the two plants is abo=

ut 2,334 MW. One of the plants is the 1,441-MW Handley Steam Electric Stati=

on, which is located southeast of Fort Worth. According to TXU, 412,000 bar=

rels of oil can be stored on site to fuel five oil/gas units at the plant. =

Handley is cooled by water from Lake Arlington. The first unit was put into=

 operation in 1948, with the additional units coming on line in 1950, 1963,=

 1976, and 1977. The other plant being sold is the 893-MW Mountain Creek St=

eam Electric Station, which is located about two miles west of Loop 12 in D=

allas. With the first oil/gas unit established in 1945, four more units wer=

e added in 1949, 1956, 1958, and 1967. Both sales include the generating un=

its of the plants, along with all of the other assets that are necessary fo=

r them to operate (land, water rights, transmission interconnections, gas p=

ipeline interconnections, production facilities, and emission allowances).



The strategies of both companies that are driving these transactions are pr=

etty straightforward. From TXU's perspective, the sales will reduce the com=

pany's generation concentration in a single U.S. market, which up to this p=

oint has been primarily in its home state of Texas. Proceeds from the sale =

apparently will be used to help TXU to expand in other North American marke=

ts outside of Texas. In addition, proceeds from the sale will be used to st=

rengthen TXU's balance sheet by reducing debt, something that has become in=

creasingly important to all companies operating in the competitive energy s=

pace since the bankruptcy of market-leader Enron. It is important to note t=

hat TXU has no plans to exit the Texas market, and still intends to operate=

 in the state as a generation company and retailer. Note that according to =

Texas restructuring law, there must be a wall between the two operating uni=

ts, which must function as separate companies. In essence, the divestiture =

is merely being used as a strategy for TXU to free up necessary cash that w=

ill support growth into other markets, and reduce the amount of potential m=

arket power that the company may have in Texas.=20



The issue of market power is another new factor that has developed in the l=

atter half of this year, considering that recent rulings by the Federal Ene=

rgy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have forced several other companies to cha=

rge cost-based prices for some wholesale transactions if they are deemed to=

 hold market power in their particular service territories. Texas law allow=

s a company to own and control no more than 20 percent of capacity within t=

he Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and TXU claims that it is=

 within this cap. However, TXU acknowledges that it had an over-concentrati=

on of generating capacity in one market and wanted to expand into other mar=

kets. Excluding the sold facilities, TXU will now own 18,651 MW of net capa=

city, which are still located primarily in Texas. However, it is becoming c=

lear that TXU intends to reduce its role in the Texas generation market.



From Exelon's perspective, the sale expands the company's generating capaci=

ty by about 10 percent, which is an important increase considering that Exe=

lon is attempting to maintain its position as one of the industry's largest=

 asset-based traders. Exelon, which was created as a result of the merger b=

etween PECO Energy and Commonwealth Edison, is known mostly for its strong =

nuclear capabilities. In fact, Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet in the =

nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear industry, =

owning a total of 17 reactors that produce about 17,000 MW of power. Exelon=

 may be attempting to create a more diversified generation portfolio. Exelo=

n Power, which will manage the output of the two plants bought from TXU, ov=

ersees Exelon's portfolio of coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydr=

o generating assets, which include 72 intermediate and peaking units in Pen=

nsylvania and Maryland (capable of producing 4,800 MW of net generating cap=

acity). Thus, Exelon's purchase of the two TXU plants could be seen as an e=

ffort to diversify, both regionally and from a power-source perspective, fr=

om the company's previous focus on nuclear power in the Northeast.=20



Perhaps equally important, the sale provides a valuable inroad to the Texas=

 market, which represents the second-largest energy market (behind Californ=

ia), offering a market value of about $20 billion. Now that California is n=

o longer a competitive energy market, there are high hopes that Texas will =

prove to be a flourishing market once full competition begins in the state =

next week. On Jan.1, 2002, most customers of investor-owned utilities in Te=

xas will have the opportunity to choose a Retail Electric Provider (REP)-th=

e company that provides their electricity. As a whole, the Texas energy mar=

ket represents 70,000 MW of generation operating on a 37,000-mile transmiss=

ion network.=20



One of Exelon's main objectives is to expand its portfolio of generation as=

sets and position itself as one of the nation's top-tier energy suppliers. =

Penetrating a state like Texas seems like a natural step for Exelon, which =

up to this point has developing generating assets that stretch from Chicago=

 to Pennsylvania. This is not the first expansion that Exelon has made into=

 the Texas market. In the summer of 2001, Exelon began operating a new 165-=

MW combustion turbine known as the ExTex LaPorte plant near Houston. Prior =

to that, Exelon had already become involved in marketing power output from =

two other plants in Texas (830 MW from the Tenaska Frontier plant and 350 M=

W from the Wolf Hollow plant).



It is important to note that Exelon and TXU are competitors in the Texas ma=

rket, especially on the wholesale side of the business, and thus there are =

fine lines drawn between the companies in light of the sales contract. Unde=

r the sales agreement, Exelon Power, Exelon Generation's power plant operat=

ion arm, will assume operation of the plants. The transaction includes a to=

lling agreement under which TXU Energy will have the right to purchase powe=

r during summer months for the next five years at market-based rates. Consi=

dering the standard definition of a tolling agreement, it is presumed that =

TXU will be providing the natural gas to operate the two plants during the =

summer months of the five-year contract, and then purchasing the electric o=

utput of the plants during that time. Interestingly, TXU is able to abide b=

y Texas' requirement that it not own and control more than 20 percent withi=

n ERCOT by selling off its ownership of these two plants. However, realisti=

cally, TXU still has a hand in the operational control of these two plants,=

 at least in the summer months during its five-year contract with Exelon. T=

his raises a philosophical question of whether or not the sales contract be=

tween TXU and Exelon truly accomplishes the goals of Texas' deregulation pl=

an.=20

After reporting last week that the cost pass through suits had been filed, I learned that Orlando Gonzales made the commercial decision to hold off on those suits because of significant progress he made in negotiations with the Brazilian government for resolution of these issues and Annex V.

Elektro received some of the information from ASMAE for calculating its numbers; however, as of Friday it had not received the information for the rationing period, the relevant period for calculating the set off.  I talked with Vasco this morning and he believed this information was received today and will confirm.  If the information is not forthcoming, we are prepared to file a suit to compel it.

I pray that all is well with you this morning. I wanted to share a
prophetic word with you on this morning that went forth after our Building

Bro Andrew shared a word that we as a people are to follow our Moses that
God has given us and that God is calling all things to order. He stated
that when the Pastor speaks and gives a word of instructions, we are to
listen and stop bickering amongst ourselves like the children of Israel and
follow the man of God.

He, Bro Andrew stated that God said that if we as a church would unite and
pray for the Pastor and his wife for the next 21 days at 3:00 and everyone
be on one accord, God said that He would move mightily.

This will be shared in an announcement on Sunday to let the
church know, this would be in line of things and that the church needs to
get to a point of obedience, because one of the reason why the church has
gone around the mountain is because things have been out of order.

God is an awesome God and we want to give Him thanks for what He doing.

German power exchanges to merge
Financial Times - October 26, 2001
By Bettina Wassener 

Germany's two electricity exchanges, the European Energy Exchange and the
Leipzig Power Exchange, confirmed on Friday that they will merge by the
start of next year in a move that will pool liquidity in Europe's biggest
power trading market. 

The rival exchanges said on Friday the move was a ""merger of equals,"" though
existing shareholders in the Frankfurt-based EEX, whose owners include the
Eurex derivatives market, will hold 57.5 per cent of the merged exchange. 

Both exchanges were started fairly recently to capitalise on the boom in
power trading after liberalisation in the electricity sector since the late
1990s, but have faced competition from bilateral trades, and jointly
represent only 6.6 per cent of the market. 

The LPX, backed by power exchange Nord Pool, launched Germany's first spot
bourse in June last year, just ahead of a similar move by its
Frankfurt-based rival. The EEX began trading electricity futures earlier
this year. 

Due to the merger, the LPX will not now go ahead with plans to launch its
own futures contract which had been expected this year. The merged exchange
will offer a combination of the existing trading systems. 

The new exchange, to be called EEX but based in Leipzig, will be run jointly
by Hans Schweickhardt, EEX's chief executive, and Carlhans Uhle, his
counterpart at the LPX. About 90 participants from nine countries will trade
at the new EEX. 


Dividend uncertainty enhances option pricing risk
Risk News - October 24, 2001
By Sarfraz Thind

The growing spate of dividend cuts in the global markets has made dividends
a potential source of uncertainty in the pricing of equity derivatives.
Companies across the board now have reduced expectations of meeting their
earnings forecasts following the downturn in the economy, which, combined
with increasing use of share buybacks and return of capital as alternative
methods of cash distribution, has placed pressure on dividends, bankers said
Michael Maras, Merrill Lynch 

The latest analysis on European equity derivative markets by Merrill Lynch
forecasts a 2.52% decline in the dividend payments of FTSE 100 constituents
for 2001. Merrill's report said that market expectations for earnings and
dividend growth remain excessively optimistic. It added that earnings and
dividend forecasts across Europe are increasingly likely to see a downward
adjustment over the next six months, with dividend growth in the Euro Stoxx
50 index declining by around 2.5%. 

Michael Maras, global equity derivatives director at Merrill Lynch, told
RiskNews that the report was intended to warn investors of potential
dividend cuts, so that they re-evaluate their dividend yield ratios. Maras
pointed to companies such as the UK's Rolls Royce and Dutch bank ABN Amro
that have already had their dividend payment ability cast under doubt. He
identified the auto, technology and financial sectors as being especially
vulnerable. 

""A lot more trading houses will be reducing dividend expectations. This is a
global phenomenon, though it's a lot more intense in Europe, as [European]
companies have an over-reliance on dividends."" 

An equity derivatives trader at Morgan Stanley, who asked not to be named,
said that Merrill Lynch was ""absolutely right"". ""We are very, very cautious
about how we price options going through the dividend period.""

(NYSE: MIR) announced on Oct. 11 =that it intends to acquire the majority of the gas marketing business of Ca=lgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Limited, a move that would make the compa=ny the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada, the largest natural-gas expo=rter to the United States and the number-two gas marketer in North America.= Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, although it is expected to close= in the fourth quarter of this year, pending approvals from regulators, pro=ducers and customers.=20Analysis: It's nothing short of amazing the number of natural-gas transacti=ons that have taken place between U.S. integrated energy firms and Canadian= gas companies in 2001 alone. As is often the case, what seemed like a tren=d now appears to be an industry standard, as those U.S. power firms consoli=dating in the natural-gas sector look northward to Canada for acquisition t=argets. Canada, which offers seemingly abundant natural-gas resources, has =attracted such U.S. energy companies Calpine, Devon and Duke, which have al=so bought gas outlets in the Great White North this year. This particular a=cquisition is significant because it positions Mirant, which already had as=sets in the Western part of Canada, as the largest gas marketer in Canada a=nd right behind Enron elsewhere in North America, especially in the U.S. Mi=dwest and Northeast. Further, the purchase of TransCanada gives Mirant a de=cided edge on the increasing exports of natural gas from Canada to the Unit=ed States, adding upon its already-significant portfolio.=20As always when discussing a merger or acquisition, I like to first establis=h the key elements of the deal before addressing the larger strategic gains= of the parties involved. Mirant is of course the recently spun off, former= subsidiary of Southern Company which over the last year has become one of =the most aggressive and visible energy companies operating in the unregulat=ed wholesale sector. The company's business model is founded on building a =huge arsenal of generating assets, particularly based in natural gas, which= can be marketed and traded in strategic regions. Even before the announcem=ent of this acquisition, Mirant owned an estimated 96 billion cubic feet of= proven oil and gas reserves, 82 percent of which are natural gas. Accordin=g to the company, a substantial portion of its 38 million cubic feet equiva=lent per day that is in current production is contracted to be sold at an a=verage fixed price of $4/MMBtu through 2002. Further, Mirant has establishe=d a solid reputation as a leading gas marketer and trader in North and Sout=h America, Europe, and Asia. The purchase of TransCanada's gas marketing bu=siness will add 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas reserves to Mirant's =existing volumes (based on TransCanada's 2000 trading volumes), which as no=ted significantly elevates Mirant's stature in the gas-marketing space.=20The most important thing to note about TransCanada's business model is that= the company has established a strong niche in transporting natural gas fro=m Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and Canada's Mackenzie Delta into the growing North =American marketplace, supporting two separate pipelines (one from each basi=n). This has been a slow-growth business for TransCanada, and in fact has l=ost money over the last year, but is positioned for strong growth in the fu=ture given the projected increase in demand for natural gas in North Americ=a. TransCanada has been attempting to sell its gas marketing business for s=ome time in an effort to focus more exclusively on its North American gas t=ransmission and electrical power services. Last month, the company sold ano=ther chunk of its U.S. natural-gas marketing and trading operations to BP G=as and Power. Some of the motivation for TransCanada to focus exclusively o=n this business might have arisen from concerns about perceived conflicts b=etween its marketing / shipping business and pipeline systems.=20From a broad perspective, this is a good move for Mirant. As noted, the com=pany already has assets in Western Canada, where it has operated since June= 2000 through its management of the natural-gas marketing operations of Pan=-Alberta Gas Ltd. and CanWest Gas Supply, Inc. The purchase of core busines=ses of TransCanada extends Mirant's presence into Eastern Canada by gaining= control over TransCanada's Quebec and Ontario operations. Specifically, Mi=rant gains control over TransCanada's natural-gas trading and marketing bus=iness and the related transportation and storage contracts, with business c=ontracts in the Midwest and Northeast United States. In addition, TransCana=da has agreed to sell its ""netback pool,"" or the part of its operation that= has aggregated gas supply from about 550 natural-gas producers. As noted, =the aggregated supply should increase Mirant's marketable reserves by 5.1 b=illion cubic feet per day. Although financial terms were not disclosed, a M=irant executive indicated that the acquisition would enable the company to =establish a leading market position through minimal investment.=20The acquisition of TransCanada is by no means a surprise as it factors in v=ery well to Mirant's growth strategy. Just this week, Mirant announced that= it had acquired an interest in 18 natural-gas and oil producing fields as =well as 206,000 acres of mineral rights in South Louisiana from Castex Ener=gy. This purchase followed purchases announced last August in which Mirant =agreed to acquire two power plants in Florida and Georgia from El Paso Corp=oration. The additional generating capacity from the El Paso facilities wou=ld bring Mirant closer to its aggressive target of owning or controlling 35=,000 MW in North America by 2005. Mirant is acquiring from El Paso a 640-MW= natural gas-fired power plant in Thomaston, Ga., and a 480-MW natural gas-=fired plant in New Port Richey, Fla., north of Tampa. The agreement is expe=cted to close this month, pending regulatory and third-party approvals.=20As noted, Mirant is just the latest in a string of U.S. energy companies th=at have made purchases of Canadian gas companies. Driven by what appear to =be abundant natural-gas reserve fields in Canada, and uncertain resources i=n more traditional areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the gas consolidation =movement among U.S. energy companies includes acquiring those firms that ar=e involved in both production and transportation of natural gas. Some recen=t reports I've seen have indicated that, since 1991, natural-gas imports to= the United States (mostly coming from Canada) have doubled to about 10 bil=lion cubic feet per day, while domestic production has increased only 4 per=cent (although it still averages 52 billion cubic feet per day). Further, a=ccording to the Department of Energy, U.S. imports of natural gas from Cana=da have averaged about 15 percent of total U.S. usage (during 2000, the Uni=ted States consumed 22.8 Tcf and imported about 3.6 Tcf, mostly from Canada=). The other factor driving this interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is =the relatively lower valuations of Canadian energy stocks.=20Worth noting in this movement is Duke Energy, which announced its purchase =of Canada's Westcoast Energy for $3.5 billion in late September. Westcoast =Energy owns the main pipeline that transports natural gas into the United S=tates, which is a booming market for natural-gas demand given its use in ne=w power plant projects. The acquisition should give Duke control over natur=al-gas supply in Canada and the pipelines needed to export it. It is import=ant to note that Duke has found its niche in the Canadian natural-gas marke=t by focusing on the transportation of the commodity. Mirant is taking a di=fferent approach by focusing on the marketing side of the business. Also wo=rth noting in the Canadian market is Devon Energy, which is buying Anderson= Exploration, which reportedly will position it as the largest independent =producer of oil and natural gas in North America.=20Ironically, this increased interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is taking= place at a time when Canadian natural-gas storage levels could be much hig=her than reported, bringing prices down to (CAN) $1.75 per million cubic fe=et over the next few weeks. In fact, natural-gas prices in Canada have drop=ped about 80 percent since the beginning of 2001, with Alberta's benchmark =AECO-C Hub prices dropping more than 40 percent in the past two months. In =addition to the high storage levels, mild weather, a drop in consumption of= natural gas and the struggling North American economy are also considered =to be factors in the drop in prices. However, this does appear to be a temp=orary trend, and companies such as Mirant are betting that prices will once= again increase, starting with the imminent winter season.=20Moreover, as noted the purchase of TransCanada will reportedly make Mirant =the second-largest gas marketer in North America. According to the most cur=rent data available, based on 2000 sales, Enron Wholesale Services remains =the largest natural-gas marketer in North America, with 28.3 billion cubic =feet / day of sales in 2000, representing an 82.6-percent increase over 199=9 levels. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trade, Co=ral Energy, and Reliant Energy round out the top companies. Interestingly, =Mirant was not even listed on the year-2000 sales ranking because it did no=t fully spin off from parent Southern Company until late in the year. Conse=quently, the ascendance into the top tier of natural-gas marketers that Mir=ant should achieve through this single purchase of TransCanada is quite imp=ressive.=20An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available atwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

Mirant Becomes No. 2 Gas Marketer;=20

New Acquisition Cements Canada as Top Spot for Gas Resources=20

[News item from PR Newswire] Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) announced on Oct. 11 =

that it intends to acquire the majority of the gas marketing business of Ca=

lgary-based TransCanada Pipelines Limited, a move that would make the compa=

ny the largest natural-gas marketer in Canada, the largest natural-gas expo=

rter to the United States and the number-two gas marketer in North America.=

 Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, although it is expected to close=

 in the fourth quarter of this year, pending approvals from regulators, pro=

ducers and customers.=20



Analysis: It's nothing short of amazing the number of natural-gas transacti=

ons that have taken place between U.S. integrated energy firms and Canadian=

 gas companies in 2001 alone. As is often the case, what seemed like a tren=

d now appears to be an industry standard, as those U.S. power firms consoli=

dating in the natural-gas sector look northward to Canada for acquisition t=

argets. Canada, which offers seemingly abundant natural-gas resources, has =

attracted such U.S. energy companies Calpine, Devon and Duke, which have al=

so bought gas outlets in the Great White North this year. This particular a=

cquisition is significant because it positions Mirant, which already had as=

sets in the Western part of Canada, as the largest gas marketer in Canada a=

nd right behind Enron elsewhere in North America, especially in the U.S. Mi=

dwest and Northeast. Further, the purchase of TransCanada gives Mirant a de=

cided edge on the increasing exports of natural gas from Canada to the Unit=

ed States, adding upon its already-significant portfolio.=20



As always when discussing a merger or acquisition, I like to first establis=

h the key elements of the deal before addressing the larger strategic gains=

 of the parties involved. Mirant is of course the recently spun off, former=

 subsidiary of Southern Company which over the last year has become one of =

the most aggressive and visible energy companies operating in the unregulat=

ed wholesale sector. The company's business model is founded on building a =

huge arsenal of generating assets, particularly based in natural gas, which=

 can be marketed and traded in strategic regions. Even before the announcem=

ent of this acquisition, Mirant owned an estimated 96 billion cubic feet of=

 proven oil and gas reserves, 82 percent of which are natural gas. Accordin=

g to the company, a substantial portion of its 38 million cubic feet equiva=

lent per day that is in current production is contracted to be sold at an a=

verage fixed price of $4/MMBtu through 2002. Further, Mirant has establishe=

d a solid reputation as a leading gas marketer and trader in North and Sout=

h America, Europe, and Asia. The purchase of TransCanada's gas marketing bu=

siness will add 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas reserves to Mirant's =

existing volumes (based on TransCanada's 2000 trading volumes), which as no=

ted significantly elevates Mirant's stature in the gas-marketing space.=20



The most important thing to note about TransCanada's business model is that=

 the company has established a strong niche in transporting natural gas fro=

m Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and Canada's Mackenzie Delta into the growing North =

American marketplace, supporting two separate pipelines (one from each basi=

n). This has been a slow-growth business for TransCanada, and in fact has l=

ost money over the last year, but is positioned for strong growth in the fu=

ture given the projected increase in demand for natural gas in North Americ=

a. TransCanada has been attempting to sell its gas marketing business for s=

ome time in an effort to focus more exclusively on its North American gas t=

ransmission and electrical power services. Last month, the company sold ano=

ther chunk of its U.S. natural-gas marketing and trading operations to BP G=

as and Power. Some of the motivation for TransCanada to focus exclusively o=

n this business might have arisen from concerns about perceived conflicts b=

etween its marketing / shipping business and pipeline systems.=20



From a broad perspective, this is a good move for Mirant. As noted, the com=

pany already has assets in Western Canada, where it has operated since June=

 2000 through its management of the natural-gas marketing operations of Pan=

-Alberta Gas Ltd. and CanWest Gas Supply, Inc. The purchase of core busines=

ses of TransCanada extends Mirant's presence into Eastern Canada by gaining=

 control over TransCanada's Quebec and Ontario operations. Specifically, Mi=

rant gains control over TransCanada's natural-gas trading and marketing bus=

iness and the related transportation and storage contracts, with business c=

ontracts in the Midwest and Northeast United States. In addition, TransCana=

da has agreed to sell its ""netback pool,"" or the part of its operation that=

 has aggregated gas supply from about 550 natural-gas producers. As noted, =

the aggregated supply should increase Mirant's marketable reserves by 5.1 b=

illion cubic feet per day. Although financial terms were not disclosed, a M=

irant executive indicated that the acquisition would enable the company to =

establish a leading market position through minimal investment.=20



The acquisition of TransCanada is by no means a surprise as it factors in v=

ery well to Mirant's growth strategy. Just this week, Mirant announced that=

 it had acquired an interest in 18 natural-gas and oil producing fields as =

well as 206,000 acres of mineral rights in South Louisiana from Castex Ener=

gy. This purchase followed purchases announced last August in which Mirant =

agreed to acquire two power plants in Florida and Georgia from El Paso Corp=

oration. The additional generating capacity from the El Paso facilities wou=

ld bring Mirant closer to its aggressive target of owning or controlling 35=

,000 MW in North America by 2005. Mirant is acquiring from El Paso a 640-MW=

 natural gas-fired power plant in Thomaston, Ga., and a 480-MW natural gas-=

fired plant in New Port Richey, Fla., north of Tampa. The agreement is expe=

cted to close this month, pending regulatory and third-party approvals.=20



As noted, Mirant is just the latest in a string of U.S. energy companies th=

at have made purchases of Canadian gas companies. Driven by what appear to =

be abundant natural-gas reserve fields in Canada, and uncertain resources i=

n more traditional areas such as the Gulf of Mexico, the gas consolidation =

movement among U.S. energy companies includes acquiring those firms that ar=

e involved in both production and transportation of natural gas. Some recen=

t reports I've seen have indicated that, since 1991, natural-gas imports to=

 the United States (mostly coming from Canada) have doubled to about 10 bil=

lion cubic feet per day, while domestic production has increased only 4 per=

cent (although it still averages 52 billion cubic feet per day). Further, a=

ccording to the Department of Energy, U.S. imports of natural gas from Cana=

da have averaged about 15 percent of total U.S. usage (during 2000, the Uni=

ted States consumed 22.8 Tcf and imported about 3.6 Tcf, mostly from Canada=

). The other factor driving this interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is =

the relatively lower valuations of Canadian energy stocks.=20



Worth noting in this movement is Duke Energy, which announced its purchase =

of Canada's Westcoast Energy for $3.5 billion in late September. Westcoast =

Energy owns the main pipeline that transports natural gas into the United S=

tates, which is a booming market for natural-gas demand given its use in ne=

w power plant projects. The acquisition should give Duke control over natur=

al-gas supply in Canada and the pipelines needed to export it. It is import=

ant to note that Duke has found its niche in the Canadian natural-gas marke=

t by focusing on the transportation of the commodity. Mirant is taking a di=

fferent approach by focusing on the marketing side of the business. Also wo=

rth noting in the Canadian market is Devon Energy, which is buying Anderson=

 Exploration, which reportedly will position it as the largest independent =

producer of oil and natural gas in North America.=20



Ironically, this increased interest in Canadian natural-gas firms is taking=

 place at a time when Canadian natural-gas storage levels could be much hig=

her than reported, bringing prices down to (CAN) $1.75 per million cubic fe=

et over the next few weeks. In fact, natural-gas prices in Canada have drop=

ped about 80 percent since the beginning of 2001, with Alberta's benchmark =

AECO-C Hub prices dropping more than 40 percent in the past two months. In =

addition to the high storage levels, mild weather, a drop in consumption of=

 natural gas and the struggling North American economy are also considered =

to be factors in the drop in prices. However, this does appear to be a temp=

orary trend, and companies such as Mirant are betting that prices will once=

 again increase, starting with the imminent winter season.=20



Moreover, as noted the purchase of TransCanada will reportedly make Mirant =

the second-largest gas marketer in North America. According to the most cur=

rent data available, based on 2000 sales, Enron Wholesale Services remains =

the largest natural-gas marketer in North America, with 28.3 billion cubic =

feet / day of sales in 2000, representing an 82.6-percent increase over 199=

9 levels. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trade, Co=

ral Energy, and Reliant Energy round out the top companies. Interestingly, =

Mirant was not even listed on the year-2000 sales ranking because it did no=

t fully spin off from parent Southern Company until late in the year. Conse=

quently, the ascendance into the top tier of natural-gas marketers that Mir=

ant should achieve through this single purchase of TransCanada is quite imp=

ressive.=20

We have no reason to believe that we will not go to trial on the 13th.  We expect the trial to last from 10 days to 2 weeks. Judge Ira Gammerman will try the case. There is no jury. 	The second development deals with the proposed summary judgment motions mentioned in my last e-mail.  Summary judgments on liability and damages have been filed and the plaintiffs have responded.  We have filed replies to their opposition papers.  In addition, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.  We filed opposition papers to this motion.  New York practice differs somewhat from Texas practice to the extent that we have no firm date for a hearing on these motions.  Although we are attempting to get a hearing before the trial date, the judge has complete discretion as to whether to hear the parties' motions for summary judgment before the start of trial.	The third development relates to the plaintiffs' theory of the case. It seems clear from the papers filed in response to our motions for summary judgment that the plaintiffs are fine-tuning their case to focus on the contracts' size distribution requirement arguing that the type of coal supplied by Enron, whether crushed or not, could never meet the contracts' size distribution requirement. The plaintiffs make this argument in simple terms and, when argued as such, it has some appeal. However, it is Enron's position that the contracts' language is ambiguous and the better (and much more complicated) approach advanced by the defendants is that the subject coal could and would have met the size distribution requirements. Issues of whether the contracts are installment contracts also play heavily in this analysis. 	Fourth, since the last e-mail on this matter, we have learned that the plaintiffs are seeking $71 million in damages from Enron. This is approximately half of the amount of the contracts' damage cap. 	Lastly, we finally received a response from the plaintiffs to the settlement proposal we made in June. The plaintiffs have offered to resolve this matter for a cash payment by Enron of $45 million. In the alternative, the plaintiffs have proposed a business alternative which is currently being investigated. Additionally, there is some discussion of mediation in the limited time remaining before trial.	Should you have any questions about this case or should you need any further information, please call me.","{}","In September I sent you all a summary of the facts at issue in the above-referenced lawsuit.

For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality. EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company. The website links for the Workshop and Conference are provided below:Performance-Based Ratemaking: Theory and Applications Workshop, Dec. 5, 2001, Denver, CO<http://www.euci.com/wrkshpoverview.asp?ConfID=9&WrkshpID=4>Performance-Based Ratemaking Conference, Dec. 6-7, 2001, Denver, CO<http://www.euci.com/confoverview.asp?ConfID=9> Electric Power Market Performance ConferenceDecember 12-14, 2001, Denver, COOVERVIEW Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT.

December 5-7, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Performance Based Ratemaking (PBR) is emerging as a key element of the restructuring of the electric utility industry. For PBR to be effective it must be designed carefully and uniquely for each utility so as to align the interests of the utility, the shareholders and the customers and also to make sure that PBR is successful in achieving efficiency and service quality.

 

EUCI has put together a covey of expert speakers to review and address the latest PBR developments and applications.  Join us in Denver and get the latest state-of-the-art information and insights you will need to develop an effective PBR strategy for your company.

Electric Power Market Performance Conference

December 12-14, 2001, Denver, CO

OVERVIEW

 

Each year there is additional opportunity to draw lessons regarding electricity market structure and design from actual market performance. These lessons are leading to a convergence in market design, at least in the Eastern Interconnection and ERCOT. One focus of this conference will be on the lessons to be drawn from the experience of the new ERCOT markets, the continuing market design problems in California, and the difficulties in developing and implementing a market based congestion management system in the midwest.

 

A second focus of this conference will be on the existing markets in PJM and New York, which have now moved beyond managing their internal markets and are being pushed by market participants and regulatory agencies to better address inter-RTO coordination and develop market based incentive systems for transmission expansion.

 

Finally, the conference will highlight one of the important, but little noticed successes of the Eastern ISOs, which is the explosive growth in the PJM and New York financial rights auctions.

Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =of significant events that led to our current situation:-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three= areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.Core BusinessesOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=ese include:-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.Non-Core BusinessesOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal.We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.Businesses Under ReviewThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.Credit Rating/10-Q FilingWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin= and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =19.We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=stors under ""SEC Filings.""=20=20In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=n.

of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.



We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=

ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=

y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=

ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.



It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =

of significant events that led to our current situation:



-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=

re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=

rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=

r imagined when we made these investments;



-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=

ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=

tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;



-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=

vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;



-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=

stand financial and operating disclosures; and



-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=

iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=

usly reported earnings.



We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=

 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.



Core Businesses



Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=

nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=

ese include:



-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;



-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;



-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and



-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.



The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=

r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=

me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=

 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=

.



I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =

of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =

concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=

mprovement in our counterparty relationships.



Non-Core Businesses



Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=

ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=

 return from them has been dismal.



We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =

that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=

 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=

ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=

ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=

G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=

s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=

 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.



Businesses Under Review



These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=

s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=

eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=

rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=

icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.



Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=

 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=

ecomes available.



Credit Rating/10-Q Filing



We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =

our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=

lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=

edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:



-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""



-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""



-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""



We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=

 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=

0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =

19.



We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=

ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =

call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =

few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=

stors under ""SEC Filings.""

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =

joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=

n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=

xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=

 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=

curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=

(NYSE: EPG) was cleared on Oct. 9 of= manipulating natural-gas prices in California, but the agency judge overse=eing the case expressed impatience with company executives who engaged in w=hat he described as ""hanky panky"" in arranging pipeline shipments. Curtis W=agner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, ruled that El Paso did not un=fairly drive up natural-gas prices on its four pipelines into energy-starve=d California last year, but used blunt language in assessing the behavior o=f two executives with the Houston-based energy giant. Wagner said telephone= records of the conversations showed ""blatant collusion"" between company af=filiates in booking pipeline space at a discounted rate for future shipment=s.=20Analysis: The best assessment of this ruling in the ongoing case against El= Paso Corp. is that it is a mixed bag of judgments, and only one more step =in what will continue to be a very long and drawn-out case. On one hand, th=e FERC administrative law judge appears to be absolving El Paso Corp. of th=e accusations that it intentionally manipulated conditions in California to= gain market power over the state's natural-gas market. That is the good ne=ws for El Paso Corp. However, on the other hand, the same judge has also in=tensified lingering claims that El Paso exclusively shared market-sensitive= information between its affiliates, violating a FERC standard of conduct t=hat a pipeline must give information about natural-gas transportation to al=l potential shippers as well as a company's own marketing affiliates. Furth=er, as noted Judge Curtis Wagner has indicated that existing telephone reco=rds from last year indicate ""blatant collusion"" between El Paso Corp. compa=ny affiliates, potentially violating FERC rules that a pipeline's operating= staff and the staff of its marketing affiliate function independently of e=ach other. The next step in this case will be to determine any possible fin=es that might be affixed by the full FERC commission on the basis of the al=leged collusion or affiliate abuse issues.=20The case against El Paso Corp. is a very complicated one, but it essentiall=y comes down to one core issue. The case revolves around allegations that d=uring the period of May to November 2000 El Paso improperly shared market-s=ensitive information with one of its affiliates, which drove up natural-gas= prices, pre-empted competition from non-affiliated companies and resulted =in extra costs for fuel in the range of $3.7 billion for Californians. El P=aso Corp. has consistently maintained that it engaged in no wrongdoing. The= case has carried enormous significance for the energy industry as it impac=ts not only the profits earned by El Paso Corp. but also the degree to whic=h federal regulators may continue to intercede into wholesale markets. In a=ddition, the other key aspect to this case is the extent to which FERC, und=er the leadership of new Chairman Pat Wood, will exhibit strong regulatory =oversight over these claims of market abuse and issue its own harsh financi=al penalties against El Paso Corp.=20What is critically new about this case is the information now available fro=m transcripts of phone conversations between El Paso affiliates. First, let= me establish some background that will help to explain the significance of= the transcripts. El Paso Corp. is the parent of subsidiaries El Paso Natur=al Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy, which are the companies in question reg=arding the California transactions. El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated compan=y, operates pipelines and El Paso Merchant Energy, which is unregulated, ma=rkets natural gas. El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Divisio=n pipeline, which includes 14,604 miles of interstate transmission pipeline=, serving markets in California, the southwestern United States, northern M=exico, and throughout the Rocky Mountains. In early 2000, El Paso Natural G=as awarded approximately one-third of the capacity on this interstate pipel=ine to El Paso Merchant Energy. This contract essentially gave subsidiaries= of El Paso Corp. control over transporting about one-sixth of the state's =daily demand in California. As such, this gave the El Paso affiliates betwe=en 35 and 45 percent of the Southern California gas market, clearly positio=ning it as the largest natural-gas provider in the state.=20As subsidiaries, all of El Paso's operations fall under FERC's ""arms-length="" rule, which enforces a separation between affiliated production and pipel=ine companies that exist within a corporate family. Since early 2001, FERC =has been examining allegations that El Paso manipulated natural-gas prices =in California by blocking competitors' access to the interstate pipeline. C=alifornia officials have claimed that El Paso subsidiaries secretly shared =information about the pipeline that was not available to other companies. S=pecifically, the transcripts of phone conversations between executives at E=l Paso Merchant and Mojave Pipeline Co., an El Paso affiliate, reportedly i=nclude comments from El Paso Merchant that inquire about a delay in publish=ing information about the pipeline's available capacity to all potential co=mpetitors.=20The existence of these phone records gave some credence to ongoing claims t=hat El Paso had shared what should have been public information only with i=ts affiliates. According to Reuters, the executive at El Paso Merchant aske=d the executive at Mojave Pipeline to hold off on posting competitive data =about the capacity on the pipeline for a week. This allegation has importan=t ramifications. First, the sharing of this non-public information might me=an that El Paso's subsidiaries had provided preferential treatment to affil=iated subsidiaries, which gave the company as a whole an unlawful advantage= over competitors. Any potential abuse of affiliate standards could include= the unlawful exchange of classified information between subsidiaries or th=e extension of discounted prices between two affiliated companies. Yet, acc=ording to Judge Wagner this sharing of information among affiliates did not= contribute to a clear case of market power abuse, and in fact should be di=smissed outright, which is why the ruling is such a mixed bag for El Paso C=orp.=20Nevertheless, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Pacific Ga=s & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison may continue to fight the c=ase with an appeal on the ruling that could be launched within 30 days. Acc=ording to the California parties, this alleged manipulation cost California=ns an extra $3.7 billion in unnecessary power purchase costs that the two u=tilities are still attempting to recover. It is important to note that San =Diego Gas & Electric, California's third IOU, purchases all of its natural-=gas supply from Southern California Gas and is therefore not a participant =in this case against El Paso.=20In response, El Paso has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including market= manipulation or inappropriate sharing of information between its affiliate=s, and thus has not violated any standards set out by FERC in its ""arms-len=gth"" policy applied to affiliates. Instead, El Paso claims that the seeming=ly high prices that it charged in California resulted solely from nationall=y high gas prices. However, according to the Energy Information Administrat=ion, delivery prices for natural gas in California during the October 2000 =to January 2001 timeframe were considerably higher than other national mark=ets. For instance, during this time period, natural-gas prices in Californi=a were running near $23/MMBtu, while prices at Henry Hub and in Florida wer=e at around $7/MMBtu.=20El Paso says the sudden drop in natural-gas prices once its contract on the= pipeline expired is the result of constraints that are inherent in Califor=nia's distribution system. In addition, the company claims that mild weathe=r in the region and increased storage levels of natural gas have also drive=n the dramatic price swing. Further, El Paso says that it hedged most of it=s gas capacity into California to protect itself from potential losses, cut=ting potential profits in the process. The significance of this, El Paso co=ntends, is that the company's hedging indicates that it had no foreknowledg=e that gas prices would be higher than normal. In other words, El Paso hedg=ed on its gas supply because the company thought that prices would be flat =or go down. On the other hand, hedging is a common practice among seasoned =traders and gas traders have countered that hedged contracts are often reso=ld at higher multiples before the gas is ultimately delivered.=20It will be interesting to see where this case goes from here. As noted, the= ""new"" FERC that has emerged under the leadership of Pat Wood may demonstra=te a decidedly lower tolerance for any allegations of affiliate abuse and c=onsequently issue stiff penalties. In addition, it is interesting to note t=hat other pending affiliate abuse cases have recently been launched by FERC=, indicating that the commission is increasing its efforts to investigate s=uch abuse. For instance, last week FERC ordered an inquiry into whether Exe=lon Corp., PECO Energy and their affiliates improperly manipulated Northeas=t power markets in 1999 by possibly sharing non-public information. Further=, Wood has made no bones about the fact that he embraces a market philosoph=y that includes regulatory intervention when necessary. Consequently, Wood =could very well spearhead a re-examination of FERC's methodology regarding =market-based rates in markets that become deregulated, along with how merch=ant plants calculate their rates, and the ruling on potential fines against= El Paso Corp. could be the first indication of this policy change.=20An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available atwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

 manipulating natural-gas prices in California, but the agency judge overse=

 records of the conversations showed ""blatant collusion"" between company af=

filiates in booking pipeline space at a discounted rate for future shipment=

s.=20



Analysis: The best assessment of this ruling in the ongoing case against El=

 Paso Corp. is that it is a mixed bag of judgments, and only one more step =

in what will continue to be a very long and drawn-out case. On one hand, th=

e FERC administrative law judge appears to be absolving El Paso Corp. of th=

e accusations that it intentionally manipulated conditions in California to=

 gain market power over the state's natural-gas market. That is the good ne=

ws for El Paso Corp. However, on the other hand, the same judge has also in=

tensified lingering claims that El Paso exclusively shared market-sensitive=

 information between its affiliates, violating a FERC standard of conduct t=

hat a pipeline must give information about natural-gas transportation to al=

l potential shippers as well as a company's own marketing affiliates. Furth=

er, as noted Judge Curtis Wagner has indicated that existing telephone reco=

rds from last year indicate ""blatant collusion"" between El Paso Corp. compa=

ny affiliates, potentially violating FERC rules that a pipeline's operating=

 staff and the staff of its marketing affiliate function independently of e=

ach other. The next step in this case will be to determine any possible fin=

es that might be affixed by the full FERC commission on the basis of the al=

leged collusion or affiliate abuse issues.=20



The case against El Paso Corp. is a very complicated one, but it essentiall=

y comes down to one core issue. The case revolves around allegations that d=

uring the period of May to November 2000 El Paso improperly shared market-s=

ensitive information with one of its affiliates, which drove up natural-gas=

 prices, pre-empted competition from non-affiliated companies and resulted =

in extra costs for fuel in the range of $3.7 billion for Californians. El P=

aso Corp. has consistently maintained that it engaged in no wrongdoing. The=

 case has carried enormous significance for the energy industry as it impac=

ts not only the profits earned by El Paso Corp. but also the degree to whic=

h federal regulators may continue to intercede into wholesale markets. In a=

ddition, the other key aspect to this case is the extent to which FERC, und=

er the leadership of new Chairman Pat Wood, will exhibit strong regulatory =

oversight over these claims of market abuse and issue its own harsh financi=

al penalties against El Paso Corp.=20



What is critically new about this case is the information now available fro=

m transcripts of phone conversations between El Paso affiliates. First, let=

 me establish some background that will help to explain the significance of=

 the transcripts. El Paso Corp. is the parent of subsidiaries El Paso Natur=

al Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy, which are the companies in question reg=

arding the California transactions. El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated compan=

y, operates pipelines and El Paso Merchant Energy, which is unregulated, ma=

rkets natural gas. El Paso Natural Gas owns and manages the Western Divisio=

n pipeline, which includes 14,604 miles of interstate transmission pipeline=

, serving markets in California, the southwestern United States, northern M=

exico, and throughout the Rocky Mountains. In early 2000, El Paso Natural G=

as awarded approximately one-third of the capacity on this interstate pipel=

ine to El Paso Merchant Energy. This contract essentially gave subsidiaries=

 of El Paso Corp. control over transporting about one-sixth of the state's =

daily demand in California. As such, this gave the El Paso affiliates betwe=

en 35 and 45 percent of the Southern California gas market, clearly positio=

ning it as the largest natural-gas provider in the state.=20



As subsidiaries, all of El Paso's operations fall under FERC's ""arms-length=

"" rule, which enforces a separation between affiliated production and pipel=

ine companies that exist within a corporate family. Since early 2001, FERC =

has been examining allegations that El Paso manipulated natural-gas prices =

in California by blocking competitors' access to the interstate pipeline. C=

alifornia officials have claimed that El Paso subsidiaries secretly shared =

information about the pipeline that was not available to other companies. S=

pecifically, the transcripts of phone conversations between executives at E=

l Paso Merchant and Mojave Pipeline Co., an El Paso affiliate, reportedly i=

nclude comments from El Paso Merchant that inquire about a delay in publish=

ing information about the pipeline's available capacity to all potential co=

mpetitors.=20



The existence of these phone records gave some credence to ongoing claims t=

hat El Paso had shared what should have been public information only with i=

ts affiliates. According to Reuters, the executive at El Paso Merchant aske=

d the executive at Mojave Pipeline to hold off on posting competitive data =

about the capacity on the pipeline for a week. This allegation has importan=

t ramifications. First, the sharing of this non-public information might me=

an that El Paso's subsidiaries had provided preferential treatment to affil=

iated subsidiaries, which gave the company as a whole an unlawful advantage=

 over competitors. Any potential abuse of affiliate standards could include=

 the unlawful exchange of classified information between subsidiaries or th=

e extension of discounted prices between two affiliated companies. Yet, acc=

ording to Judge Wagner this sharing of information among affiliates did not=

 contribute to a clear case of market power abuse, and in fact should be di=

smissed outright, which is why the ruling is such a mixed bag for El Paso C=

orp.=20



Nevertheless, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Pacific Ga=

s & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison may continue to fight the c=

ase with an appeal on the ruling that could be launched within 30 days. Acc=

ording to the California parties, this alleged manipulation cost California=

ns an extra $3.7 billion in unnecessary power purchase costs that the two u=

tilities are still attempting to recover. It is important to note that San =

Diego Gas & Electric, California's third IOU, purchases all of its natural-=

gas supply from Southern California Gas and is therefore not a participant =

in this case against El Paso.=20



In response, El Paso has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including market=

 manipulation or inappropriate sharing of information between its affiliate=

s, and thus has not violated any standards set out by FERC in its ""arms-len=

gth"" policy applied to affiliates. Instead, El Paso claims that the seeming=

El Paso says the sudden drop in natural-gas prices once its contract on the=

 pipeline expired is the result of constraints that are inherent in Califor=

nia's distribution system. In addition, the company claims that mild weathe=

traders and gas traders have countered that hedged contracts are often reso=

ld at higher multiples before the gas is ultimately delivered.=20



It will be interesting to see where this case goes from here. As noted, the=

 ""new"" FERC that has emerged under the leadership of Pat Wood may demonstra=

te a decidedly lower tolerance for any allegations of affiliate abuse and c=

onsequently issue stiff penalties. In addition, it is interesting to note t=

could very well spearhead a re-examination of FERC's methodology regarding =

The votes were cast at a special stockholder meeting. More than 441 million shares, 99 percent of the shares voted, approved the common stock issuance, and more than 438 million shares, 68 percent of the shares entitled to vote, approved the name change to ChevronTexaco Corporation. The companies intend to close the merger later today. Analysis: While the energy market has seen many deals this year, nothing matches the colossus created by this merger. The combination of San Francisco-based Chevron (NYSE: CHV) and White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco (NYSE:TX) creates a company with annual revenues of over $96 billion. In terms of market capitalization, the new company will rank second among U.S. energy companies with only Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) being larger. Chevron agreed to buy Texaco last October in a stock deal valued at approximately $39.3 billion, plus the assumption of about $6 billion in debt. Under the terms of the deal, Texaco shareholders receive .77 shares of Chevron common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron shareholders will retain their existing shares. Chevron will be renamed ChevronTexaco and will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol CVX. Next year, the new company will place its headquarters in suburban San Ramon, Calif. The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and operations throughout the world. In the United States, ChevronTexaco will be the nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1 million BOE per day, and will hold the nation's third largest reserve position, with 4.2 billion BOE of proven reserves. The approval from shareholders represents the final hurdle to the merger. European regulators have already granted approval, and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) voted 4-0 to approve the merger last month. Chevron and Texaco also recently negotiated a consent decree with the attorneys general of 12 states. To satisfy the FTC's apprehension that the merger, as initially proposed, would violate antitrust law, Texaco agreed to divest its U.S. refining and marketing affiliates. Texaco refines crude oil in the United States under two separate affiliates, Equilon Enterprises and Motiva Enterprises. The company owns a 44-percent interest in Equilon, with the remainder belonging to Shell. Texaco and Saudi Refining each own 35 percent of Motiva. The rest is owned by Shell. In addition, Texaco will sell its one-third interest in the Discovery natural-gas pipeline system in the Gulf of Mexico and its general aviation businesses in 14 states. Although Texaco and Chevron have been rivals, the two companies have a long business relationship. For the past 65 years, they have co-owned a prosperous joint venture called Caltex, which sells 1.8 million barrels of crude oil and petroleum products per day with operations in 60 countries. Caltex refines crude oil and marketing petroleum products, LNG and gas products with a workforce of more than 6,000. Revenues for the company and its affiliates were $20.2 billion in 2000. This merger appears to be a good fit for many reasons. One benefit is that the two companies have many complementary operations internationally, including West Africa and Brazil, home to some of the world's largest new oil fields. The new company will have a leadership position in power generation. Texaco's power and gasification business, with equity interests in 3,500 megawatts of power operating or under construction, and Chevron's 26-percent stake in Dynegy, Inc., will strengthen the company's position in the gasification and power generation markets. In addition, the sheer size of the new company should allow it to better cope with fluctuating crude prices and provide a greater ability to undertake global projects that are growing in complexity, size and cost. The stock market attests to these economies of scale. The stock prices for Chevron and Texaco, though up about 50 percent and 60 percent over the past five years, have under-performed those of the gargantuan players like ExxonMobil and BP. After gaining enormous size through mergers in recent years, these two companies have seen their shares return about 70 percent and 80 percent, respectively. ExxonMobil and BP have seen their price/earnings multiples command significant premiums as well. Chevron and Texaco currently have price/earnings multiples of about 9.2 and 12.3 respectively, while BP and ExxonMobil command price/earnings multiples of approximately 15.1 and 16.3 respectively. These significant stock price premiums that ExxonMobil and BP have obtained after their mergers bode nicely for ChevronTexaco. It now joins the ranks of these major players. As mentioned earlier, in terms of market capitalization, the new company will rank second among U.S. energy companies, and fourth among global energy companies, with a market capitalization approaching $100 billion. The new company expects to reduce costs by at least $1.2 billion per year within six to nine months of the merger's completion. The most significant savings (approximately $700 million) are projected to come from more efficient exploration and production activities. An additional $300 million is expected to come from the consolidation of corporate functions, and $200 million from other operations. The company anticipates that the combined workforce of about 57,000 will be reduced by approximately 7 percent worldwide. These projected expense reductions of $1.2 billion could be just an initial payoff. Looking at the recent mergers of BP and ExxonMobil, history suggests that the major oil companies underestimate their scope for slashing costs. For example, since the merger of Exxon and Mobil in 1999, savings estimates have been raised by about $1 billion in each of the years 2000 to 2002. In addition, BP has almost doubled initial savings expectations in its various mergers to $4 billion from $2.2 billion. So, it is not inconceivable that the merger could reduce costs perhaps up to twice as much as currently projected, and that would translate into earnings for next year and beyond being much higher than anticipated. The creation of ChevronTexaco adds a new player to the oil and gas elite. Rather than being acquired by ExxonMobil Corp., BP Amoco Plc, or Royal Dutch Shell Group, as was becoming more likely with each passing month, Chevron and Texaco became their equal. An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available atwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/> We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

Just a quick question while I remember, as you know I am giving an overview of the DASH process and the Legal Risk Memo that must accompany any DASH.
My understanding is that the Legal Risk Memo must be attached to the DASH when the DASH is circulated and that on the face of the DASH form prepared by RAC, we should not be and there should not appear any Legal Risk assessment, which must only be contained in the Legal Risk Memo. The DASH should simply refer to ""See attached Legal Risk Memo"".
	
I am hoping that this is also how you like to see the process work in practice.

In addition I am going to say that if possible you need to be briefed and receive a draft of the Legal Risk Memo before it is circulated with the DASH.

My apologies for adding to your burden at this difficult time. However hopefully this might clarify our discussions of yesterday and enable us all to move on quickly.

Enron Europe and its directors are facing two related issues: 

1. Continuing to trade

The directors of EEL and its subsids have to be satisfied that there is a reasonable prospect of avoiding an insolvent liquidation. This is a fairly low hurdle to pass and, in our situation, calls made on Corp. for cash have been promptly met and we have read the news today of a new confirmed facility so we already have a fair degree of comfort. 

The directors meet with independent counsel tomorrow but I believe that they will probably come out of that session asking for nothing more than a confirmation, by email to say Michael Brown, but from the top - Jeff or Greg, of where they currently see things, ie a positive prognosis for the future. That piece of electronic paper should be enough to enable the directors to reasonably conclude that we are not hurtling into Chapt 11 and to continue to trade. It would also be very helpful if that email could confirm that Michael would be promptly informed if things took a downward turn.  

I would be happy to draft a note but wonder whether the best way of quickly putting this to bed might be for a conversation to be had with Jeff/Greg to see what they would be prepared to say. That could then be drafted up and sent over. 


2. Filing accounts

The directors of Enron Europe and its subsids cannot file accounts on a going concern basis unless they are comfortable they will have adequate funds in the medium term to run their businesses. The hurdle here is higher than in point 1 above as prospective cash shortages would require the accounts to be qualified long before the directors would have to stop trading under point 1 above. So more comfort will probably be required here, which could include further details of the new facility (drawdown conditions and maturity periods) and prospects for further facilities being signed. This would back up the usual support letter. 

I should add that we have not actually received this year the usual support letter from Corp. addressed to Enron Europe and its subsids. I don't know if it has been formally requested but we will definitely need to see that document this time around. Could you please point me in the right direction for that? 

We now have until the end of January to file the accounts so point 1 above is definitely the immediately crucial issue. We would however like to resolve the accounts issue as soon as possible. Perhaps we could liaise with Joel to get a letter drafted and then signed by Jeff or Greg? 


That's it. It really boils down to requiring a bit more information from Corp. There is absolutely no desire to cause problems here, just a desire to put in place the right pieces of information (which we are sure are out there but we need to collect them in) which will safeguard the European directors personally and enable them to move on from these concerns to the more pressing business of Q4.

In our discussions today with BNDES they committed to resolving the open points for Cuiaba, and to finalize the proposal for Eletrobolt generation and the LDC issues by Wednesday next week,  but it is slow going.

Subject:	RE: Cuiaba/Electrobolt


Orlando;
Sorry.  I realized last night I had forgot.  We can send you an OPIC
brochure with the pricing tables included but the relevant section shows
under a category called institutional loans and leases and the subheading is
expropriation cover.  The range of pricing quoted is .40 to .90 annually
i.e. 40 to 90 basis points annually.  OPIC typically requires the annual
premium to be paid in advance.

I will try to track down the Electrobolt points today.

With this approval=, Gulfstream now has all the major segments of its 753-mile pipeline projec=t under construction and on schedule to deliver natural gas in June 2002.==20Analysis: The Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is by far the largest pi=peline project in the Southeast, has been designed specifically to deliver =natural gas into the Florida wholesale market. When finished, the project r=eportedly will be the largest natural-gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico, w=ith capacity to transport approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural g=as per day, and the first new transportation system to serve Florida in mor=e than 40 years. Williams (NYSE: WMB) and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) jointly o=wn the pipeline, having purchased it from Coastal Corp. last year, a sale t=hat was made possible due to regulatory requirements surrounding Coastal's =merger with El Paso Corp. Along with projects still being led by El Paso Co=rp. (NYSE: EPG), the Gulfstream project highlights the continuing emphasis =on pipeline construction, which by some accounts is experiencing the larges=t wave of expansion since the early 1960s.=20Williams and Duke have provided a current status report regarding construct=ion of the pipeline, including notice that more than 200 of the 431 miles o=f offshore pipeline have been laid in the Gulf of Mexico. Gulfstream also h=as already laid pipe in parts of Florida and Alabama, some of the more sens=itive regions along the pipeline's path.=20Like other pipeline developments, the Gulfstream project, the construction =for which began on June 1, 2001, is being driven by several factors, includ=ing demand (which for the most part remains strong), the prominence of natu=ral gas as the fuel source for new power plants and a presidential administ=ration that is supportive of production. What is perhaps most interesting a=bout the boom in pipeline construction is that many of the same companies t=hat own or control natural-gas supplies are also quickly acquiring or partn=ering with other firms that specialize in pipeline construction.=20For background, subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their in=tent to jointly purchase Coastal Corp.'s 100-percent interest in the Gulfst=ream Natural Gas System project in November 2000. The project was originall=y sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp., a $16 billion Houston-based e=nergy holding company with operations in natural-gas production, distributi=on and marketing. However, due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Co=rp.'s merger with El Paso Energy Corp., Coastal Corp. was forced by the Fed=eral Trade Commission to divest the project. As a result, Duke Energy and W=illiams found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project= and its valuable inroad to the Florida market.=20Approximately 400 miles of the route, which originates in Mobile, Ala., cro=sses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters. Gul=fstream offers 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural-gas capacity per day, and =is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and power-generation facil=ities that plan on using high-efficiency natural-gas turbines. Already, the= project has precedent agreements with 10 large Florida utilities and power= generation facilities.=20Duke and Williams have agreed to jointly manage the operation and developme=nt of the Gulfstream project. It's not difficult to assess why Duke and Wil=liams would be willing to co-own the project. The two companies, which have= historically had a collaborative relationship, already own significant amo=unts of interstate natural-gas pipeline capacity. Between its two subsidiar=ies involved in natural-gas production-Duke Energy Field Services and Duke =Energy Gas Transmission-Duke Energy owns and operates about 57,000 miles of= pipeline and 12,000 interstate miles of capacity.

Williams and Duke Commence Construction

[News item from Business Wire] Gulfstream National Gas System announced tod=

ay that it has received Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approva=

l to commence mainline pipeline construction in Florida. With this approval=

, Gulfstream now has all the major segments of its 753-mile pipeline projec=

t under construction and on schedule to deliver natural gas in June 2002.=

=20



Analysis: The Gulfstream Natural Gas System, which is by far the largest pi=

peline project in the Southeast, has been designed specifically to deliver =

natural gas into the Florida wholesale market. When finished, the project r=

eportedly will be the largest natural-gas pipeline in the Gulf of Mexico, w=

ith capacity to transport approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural g=

as per day, and the first new transportation system to serve Florida in mor=

e than 40 years. Williams (NYSE: WMB) and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) jointly o=

wn the pipeline, having purchased it from Coastal Corp. last year, a sale t=

hat was made possible due to regulatory requirements surrounding Coastal's =

merger with El Paso Corp. Along with projects still being led by El Paso Co=

rp. (NYSE: EPG), the Gulfstream project highlights the continuing emphasis =

on pipeline construction, which by some accounts is experiencing the larges=

t wave of expansion since the early 1960s.=20



Williams and Duke have provided a current status report regarding construct=

ion of the pipeline, including notice that more than 200 of the 431 miles o=

f offshore pipeline have been laid in the Gulf of Mexico. Gulfstream also h=

as already laid pipe in parts of Florida and Alabama, some of the more sens=

itive regions along the pipeline's path.=20



Like other pipeline developments, the Gulfstream project, the construction =

for which began on June 1, 2001, is being driven by several factors, includ=

ing demand (which for the most part remains strong), the prominence of natu=

ral gas as the fuel source for new power plants and a presidential administ=

ration that is supportive of production. What is perhaps most interesting a=

bout the boom in pipeline construction is that many of the same companies t=

hat own or control natural-gas supplies are also quickly acquiring or partn=

ering with other firms that specialize in pipeline construction.=20



For background, subsidiaries of Duke Energy and Williams announced their in=

tent to jointly purchase Coastal Corp.'s 100-percent interest in the Gulfst=

ream Natural Gas System project in November 2000. The project was originall=

y sponsored by a subsidiary of Coastal Corp., a $16 billion Houston-based e=

nergy holding company with operations in natural-gas production, distributi=

on and marketing. However, due to regulatory mandates related to Coastal Co=

rp.'s merger with El Paso Energy Corp., Coastal Corp. was forced by the Fed=

eral Trade Commission to divest the project. As a result, Duke Energy and W=

illiams found a good window of opportunity to purchase the pipeline project=

 and its valuable inroad to the Florida market.=20



Approximately 400 miles of the route, which originates in Mobile, Ala., cro=

sses the Gulf of Mexico and will be located in federal offshore waters. Gul=

fstream offers 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural-gas capacity per day, and =

is designed to primarily serve Florida utilities and power-generation facil=

ities that plan on using high-efficiency natural-gas turbines. Already, the=

 project has precedent agreements with 10 large Florida utilities and power=

 generation facilities.=20



Duke and Williams have agreed to jointly manage the operation and developme=

nt of the Gulfstream project. It's not difficult to assess why Duke and Wil=

liams would be willing to co-own the project. The two companies, which have=

 historically had a collaborative relationship, already own significant amo=

unts of interstate natural-gas pipeline capacity. Between its two subsidiar=

ies involved in natural-gas production-Duke Energy Field Services and Duke =

Energy Gas Transmission-Duke Energy owns and operates about 57,000 miles of=

 pipeline and 12,000 interstate miles of capacity. Williams' five interstat=

e natural-gas pipelines reportedly deliver about 16 percent of the natural =

gas consumed in the United States. The company's vast 27,300-mile pipeline =

network stretches from coast to coast and from Mexico to Canada, serving mo=

re than 48 million residential, commercial and industrial natural-gas users=

. In fact, the two companies already were planning the Buccaneer Gas Pipeli=

ne project in Florida, a 674-mile pipeline that would have followed a simil=

ar route as the Gulfstream project will follow. Duke and Williams are no lo=

nger planning the Buccaneer project now that they have acquired the Gulfstr=

eam project. The addition of Gulfstream should benefit both companies and o=

ffer a prime position for them to expand their independent operations in Fl=

orida.=20



The CEO of Williams' gas pipeline group stated that the Florida market woul=

d support only one new pipeline coming into the state. By joining together,=

 Williams and Duke can both capitalize on the high-growth state as it event=

ually becomes competitive. First among the priorities for the project is to=

 ensure adequate pipeline capacity by June 2002, and meeting the projected =

10,000-MW electric generation growth that is expected in the state of Flori=

da by 2007.=20



Duke Energy also confirmed that the purchase of the Gulfstream project acce=

lerates its own entry into Florida. In fact, Richard Priory, Duke's CEO, co=

nceded at a conference last year that Duke's future success would result fr=

om its natural-gas operations. Specifically, Duke has been focused on merch=

ant plant and natural-gas pipeline construction for some time. As of this s=

ummer, Duke was rated third in announced merchant plants (behind Calpine an=

d Panda), and has made no bones about the fact that its strategy is centere=

d around building additional merchant plants and acquiring natural-gas pipe=

lines. Thus, the acquisition of Gulfstream is a perfectly appropriate move =

for the company to make.=20



Most projections place natural gas as the ongoing fuel of choice for new ge=

neration as the demand for natural gas is expected to increase from 23 tril=

lion to 30 trillion cubic feet per year by 2010. In addition, coal and nucl=

ear generation came under environmental and public scrutiny over the last t=

wo decades, at a time when natural-gas prices were comparatively low. All o=

f these factors have created a strong market for natural-gas generation.=20



Duke has had a rather difficult time penetrating the Florida market, so thi=

s pipeline could facilitate easier expansion in the state. About a year ago=

, the Florida Public Service Commission had approved the construction of a =

Duke merchant plant in New Smyrna Beach. However, the state's three IOUs ap=

pealed the decision to the Florida Supreme Court, arguing that merchant pla=

nts were not allowed under state law. The Florida Supreme Court overturned =

the decision of the state PSC, blocking Duke's entry into the state. Conseq=

uently, Duke is wisely using the acquisition of the Gulfstream project as a=

nother way to get into the Florida market (and one that is potentially more=

 profitable).=20



Along with Duke and Williams, El Paso Energy Corp. also is focused on build=

ing and acquiring new pipeline capacity. The company is the parent of subsi=

diaries El Paso Natural Gas, a regulated company that operates pipelines, a=

nd El Paso Merchant Energy, an unregulated company that markets natural gas=

Virginia Sanz de Madrid, a Spanish utility= analyst at Deutsche Bank in Madrid, says Endesa is probably looking to acq=uire existing generation or distribution companies rather than develop new =assets from scratch. She adds that Endesa is looking to spend some $2 to $3= billion to enter the U.S. energy market.=20Analysis: A common response to reports that Endesa is attempting to expand =in the United States may be: Why has the company waited so long? Along with= affording new opportunities for domestic companies, deregulation of the U.=S. electric market has also enticed several large European power firms to e=xpand their scales through a stateside acquisition. Thus, some financial an=alysts may wonder if Endesa is jumping on the U.S.-expansion bandwagon too =late. The timing may still be right for Endesa, however, considering that f=alling wholesale electricity prices across the United States and the decrea=sed value of generation assets over the last few months could actually make= a U.S. generation purchase more lucrative today than in recent years. Cons=equently, Endesa's rumored expansion efforts in the United States, and cont=inuing acquisitions across continental Europe, are part of the company's ag=gressive growth strategy.=20Under the monopoly system in Spain, Endesa was clearly the country's larges=t power firm, owning about 22,576 MW of generating capacity and controlling= 67 percent of Spain's electricity market. However, due to its own move tow=ard privatization, the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the do=mestic growth of the country's largest electric companies, requiring Endesa= to look abroad for growth opportunities. Thus, for some time there has bee=n little question that Endesa would like to develop interests across contin=ental Europe, and is not going to let any dust settle before it continues t=o expand. The fact that Endesa also plans to expand in the United States re=presents a new, but not necessarily surprising, direction for the company.==20The impetus for Endesa moving into the United States, beyond the opportunit=ies for growth that exist in this country, may be rooted in some setbacks t=hat Endesa has experienced in Spain and minimal acquisition opportunities a=cross continental Europe. In late 2000, Endesa made its first significant m=ove outside of Spain when it purchased a 30-percent interest in the French =electricity generator Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermique (SNET=). While a comparatively small company by American standards, SNET is the s=econd-largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity,= and third largest in terms of electricity generation. SNET owns five coal =plants totaling 2,600 megawatts, which generate about 6,838 GWh annually. T=his is a very low output, and in fact SNET accounts for only 2.5 percent of= the market share in France. However, given the fact that France's largest =energy company, EDF, still has a hold on about 90 percent of the market in =the country, the acquisition of the next-largest company was a major coup. =The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the compan=y's experience in coal-based electricity-which still is the power source fo=r roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent-and its pro=gressiveness in terms of technology.=20Upon the acquisition of SNET, Endesa began friendly merger proceedings with= Iberdrola, the second-largest power firm in Spain. Under the now-terminate=d deal, Endesa would have purchased Iberdrola for about $12.6 billion and c=reated a new entity well prepared to expand across Europe and Latin America=. Reportedly, the merger would have created the world's third-biggest elect=ricity company, after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron, and without question =would have marked Spain's largest industrial merger to date. For further pe=rspective, the new company created by the merger between Endesa and Iberdro=la would have had a combined market capitalization of approximately 36 bill=ion euros (or $32 billion in U.S. terms). This would have surpassed Duke En=ergy's market capitalization of $30.3 billion and been roughly the size of =American Electric Power, TXU, and Reliant put together (resulting in a $33.=8 million market capitalization). Had it materialized, the merger also woul=d have given a considerable jolt to Spain's fast-growing power market, and =altered the current playing field among Europe's largest power companies.==20However, in a major setback for Endesa's growth, Spanish authorities requir=ed that the merged company sell off some generating capacity, arguing that =Spain needed new players to increase competition. The government also ruled= that the new entity would have to lower its market share of distribution, =and authorities cut the amount of stranded costs that the new company would= be able to recoup. Although analysts had expected the merger to proceed de=spite the government conditions, Endesa and Iberdrola said the imposed gove=rnmental conditions outweighed the benefits of the merger, which would crea=te fewer synergies than initially proposed.

In addition to expansion into the United States, last month E=ndesa led a consortium that will acquire the generation assets of Enel, Ita=ly's largest generating company, for 2.63 billion euros. The generating ass=ets, which are housed under a subsidiary company known as Elettrogen, inclu=de an installed capacity of 5,700 MW that is ranked as the second-largest g=enerating firm in Italy. Elettrogen is one of three companies in which Enel= grouped its generation assets in order to comply with Italian regulatory m=andates regarding divestiture. The purchase of Elettrogen marks the first s=ignificant expansion of Endesa beyond its home territory in Spain. In the p=urchase agreement, Endesa will have 45-percent ownership of Elettrogen, par=tnering with Banco Santander Central Hispano (40 percent), a Spanish bank, =and Italian ASM Brescia (15 percent), a municipal utility that serves 400,0=00 customers in Italy.=20The acquisition of Elettrogen is an important component of Endesa's expansi=on strategy across Europe and may be an indication of how the company inten=ds to progress in the United States.

Spain's Endesa Moves In for a U.S. Acquisition=20

[News report from Power Finance & Risk] Endesa, Spain's largest utility, is=

 setting up a business development unit in New York and will shortly transf=

er three executives from its Madrid headquarters to seek out investment opp=

ortunities in the United States. Virginia Sanz de Madrid, a Spanish utility=

 analyst at Deutsche Bank in Madrid, says Endesa is probably looking to acq=

uire existing generation or distribution companies rather than develop new =

assets from scratch. She adds that Endesa is looking to spend some $2 to $3=

 billion to enter the U.S. energy market.=20



Analysis: A common response to reports that Endesa is attempting to expand =

in the United States may be: Why has the company waited so long? Along with=

 affording new opportunities for domestic companies, deregulation of the U.=

S. electric market has also enticed several large European power firms to e=

xpand their scales through a stateside acquisition. Thus, some financial an=

alysts may wonder if Endesa is jumping on the U.S.-expansion bandwagon too =

late. The timing may still be right for Endesa, however, considering that f=

alling wholesale electricity prices across the United States and the decrea=

sed value of generation assets over the last few months could actually make=

 a U.S. generation purchase more lucrative today than in recent years. Cons=

equently, Endesa's rumored expansion efforts in the United States, and cont=

inuing acquisitions across continental Europe, are part of the company's ag=

gressive growth strategy.=20



Under the monopoly system in Spain, Endesa was clearly the country's larges=

t power firm, owning about 22,576 MW of generating capacity and controlling=

 67 percent of Spain's electricity market. However, due to its own move tow=

ard privatization, the Spanish government has placed restrictions on the do=

mestic growth of the country's largest electric companies, requiring Endesa=

 to look abroad for growth opportunities. Thus, for some time there has bee=

n little question that Endesa would like to develop interests across contin=

ental Europe, and is not going to let any dust settle before it continues t=

o expand. The fact that Endesa also plans to expand in the United States re=

presents a new, but not necessarily surprising, direction for the company.=

=20



The impetus for Endesa moving into the United States, beyond the opportunit=

ies for growth that exist in this country, may be rooted in some setbacks t=

hat Endesa has experienced in Spain and minimal acquisition opportunities a=

cross continental Europe. In late 2000, Endesa made its first significant m=

ove outside of Spain when it purchased a 30-percent interest in the French =

electricity generator Societe Nationale d'Electricite et de Thermique (SNET=

). While a comparatively small company by American standards, SNET is the s=

econd-largest electricity company in France in terms of installed capacity,=

 and third largest in terms of electricity generation. SNET owns five coal =

plants totaling 2,600 megawatts, which generate about 6,838 GWh annually. T=

his is a very low output, and in fact SNET accounts for only 2.5 percent of=

 the market share in France. However, given the fact that France's largest =

energy company, EDF, still has a hold on about 90 percent of the market in =

the country, the acquisition of the next-largest company was a major coup. =

The acquisition of SNET was also attractive to Endesa because of the compan=

y's experience in coal-based electricity-which still is the power source fo=

r roughly half of the electricity produced across the Continent-and its pro=

gressiveness in terms of technology.=20



Upon the acquisition of SNET, Endesa began friendly merger proceedings with=

 Iberdrola, the second-largest power firm in Spain. Under the now-terminate=

d deal, Endesa would have purchased Iberdrola for about $12.6 billion and c=

reated a new entity well prepared to expand across Europe and Latin America=

. Reportedly, the merger would have created the world's third-biggest elect=

ricity company, after Tokyo Electric Power and Enron, and without question =

would have marked Spain's largest industrial merger to date. For further pe=

rspective, the new company created by the merger between Endesa and Iberdro=

la would have had a combined market capitalization of approximately 36 bill=

ion euros (or $32 billion in U.S. terms). This would have surpassed Duke En=

ergy's market capitalization of $30.3 billion and been roughly the size of =

American Electric Power, TXU, and Reliant put together (resulting in a $33.=

8 million market capitalization). Had it materialized, the merger also woul=

d have given a considerable jolt to Spain's fast-growing power market, and =

altered the current playing field among Europe's largest power companies.=

=20



However, in a major setback for Endesa's growth, Spanish authorities requir=

ed that the merged company sell off some generating capacity, arguing that =

Spain needed new players to increase competition. The government also ruled=

 that the new entity would have to lower its market share of distribution, =

and authorities cut the amount of stranded costs that the new company would=

 be able to recoup. Although analysts had expected the merger to proceed de=

spite the government conditions, Endesa and Iberdrola said the imposed gove=

rnmental conditions outweighed the benefits of the merger, which would crea=

te fewer synergies than initially proposed. Ironically, much of the funding=

 for Endesa's purchases have come from the sales of its own non-strategic a=

ssets that took place in preparation for the Iberdrola acquisition.=20



Moreover, the inability to grow its scale through the purchase of Iberdrola=

 has apparently prompted Endesa to concentrate on finding new acquisition o=

pportunities. In addition to expansion into the United States, last month E=

ndesa led a consortium that will acquire the generation assets of Enel, Ita=

ly's largest generating company, for 2.63 billion euros. The generating ass=

ets, which are housed under a subsidiary company known as Elettrogen, inclu=

de an installed capacity of 5,700 MW that is ranked as the second-largest g=

enerating firm in Italy. Elettrogen is one of three companies in which Enel=

 grouped its generation assets in order to comply with Italian regulatory m=

andates regarding divestiture. The purchase of Elettrogen marks the first s=

ignificant expansion of Endesa beyond its home territory in Spain. In the p=

urchase agreement, Endesa will have 45-percent ownership of Elettrogen, par=

tnering with Banco Santander Central Hispano (40 percent), a Spanish bank, =

and Italian ASM Brescia (15 percent), a municipal utility that serves 400,0=

00 customers in Italy.=20



The acquisition of Elettrogen is an important component of Endesa's expansi=

on strategy across Europe and may be an indication of how the company inten=

ds to progress in the United States. Endesa has established a goal of accum=

ulating 8,000 MW of generating capacity beyond its existing assets in Spain=

 by 2005. Through the purchase of Elettrogen and the previous purchase of S=

NET, Endesa has already reached that goal four years ahead of schedule.=20

F&J could not continue to represent Corp. on  one of the three IP matters, which is the nonprovisional patent application (although Dutton was not specific, I believe F&J lists it as the ""Method and System for the Determination of VAR"").	b.  F&J would continue to represent Corp. on the six or so abestosis matters in order to try and get Corp. dismissed, but with the understanding that if dismissal was not available, that new representation would be obtained by Corp. before trial.	c.

2.  Newer forms are triangulated swaps.  There are a series with Citibank, related to credit link notes (see Gareth Bahlmann re link notes), known as Yosemite/Delta Transactions.  There are 4 in the series (4th series had three prepays, US, Sterling and Euro).  The 5th did not close.  
3.  There is at least one other with Citibank, dated June 2001 and it is being wrapped into the pipeline credit facility and will be extinguished via the placement of the pipeline facility.  
4.  I am aware of one other (via the London office) which was extended September 2001, among Credit Suisse First Boston and ENA and Barclays.  

I suggest you contact Lisa Bills, Joe Deffner and Dan Boyle to determine a complete list.  I believe that this detail may have been determined by one of the teams formed last week.  You may wish to check with Haedicke.
In respect of accounting treatment, and book treatment, I suggest the following names:  Alan Quaintance, Clint Walden re accounting.  Dan Boyle has a name of someone who worked on placing the Delta transactions in the risk books, but I cannot remember the name.

STATE AUDITOR OFFENDED OVER EMU ALLEGATIONS

    (ANSA) - Rome, November 6 - Italy's State Auditor General
Andrea Monorchio today said he was ""deeply offended"" by
allegations in the foreign press that Italy had ""juggled the
books"" in order to qualify for European Monetary Union (EMU)at
the end of the 1990s.
     The allegations, appearing in Britain's Financial Times and
The Guardian, as well as the Wall Street Journal, involved
Italy's use of a currency swap to ""disguise"" the exact amount of
its deficit in order to meet the parameters to join the euro.
  According to Monorchio, these allegations were ""mental
masturbation.""
     Yesterday's press reports were based on a report by the
International Securities Market Association (ISMA), a
self-regulatory organization, and the Council on Foreign
Relations, an independent US-research group, in which a case was
outlined where a European country appeared to have used the
derivatives market to hide the exact size of its budget deficit.
     Although Italy was never named in the report, the FT said,
the report cited a case in which a 1995 bond issue was used in a
1997 currency swap aimed at temporarily reducing a country's
budget deficit. This example, the FT said, coincided exactly
with what happened with Italy's 1995 200 billion yen bond issue.
     Italy's qualification for EMU was orchestrated by
then-Premier Romano Prodi, now president of the European
Commission, and then-Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi,
Italy's current head of state.
     ""I am deeply offended,"" Monorchio said on the sidelines of
a meeting here with the Industrialists Union, ""I worked very
long and hard with Ciampi. We closed 1997 with a spending
deficit of 2.7% (of GDP) because the European Union would not
allow us to calculate nine trillion lire in revenue from the
sale of gold reserves. Otherwise our budget deficit would have
been, according to Eurostat, 2.4-2.5%.""
     After recalling that the EU yesterday was quick to deny
that Italy had in any way juggled its books, Monorchio added
""Can anyone seriously imagine someone like President Ciampi
involved in such skulduggery?""
     ""I myself am just a simple accountant and intend to remain
one,"" he concluded.

At the time,after the dramatic 1992 devaluation of the lira, the Italian Treasury wasgradually seeking to regain credibility in international markets, and did soby issuing bonds in a range of currencies. When the Y200bn bond was issued, the yen-lira exchange rate was at L19.3. ByDecember 1996, however, the yen had depreciated by 30 per cent to a level ofL13.4 to the yen. The Treasury then sought to lock in its currency gainsover this period. Treasury officials say they could have undertaken to start buying back theY200bn bond issue, but given its sheer size, this was unrealistic. Theytherefore decided to undertake a cross-currency swap in which the Treasurycould convert its yen liabilities into lira. The Treasury faced a serious technical problem, however. Under EuropeanUnion statistical rules pertaining at the time, the debt of all EU countriescould only be reported in the original currency in which the bonds had beenissued, in this case yen. Any swap contract agreed by the Treasury in order to close its foreignexchange risk would thus be irrelevant when it came to calculating theoverall debt figure. This was highly pertinent to how the swap agreement had to be structured. The Italian Treasury could have simply closed the swap transaction when theY200bn bond matured in September 1998, realising all its exchange rate gainsat that date. But a strong appreciation of the yen during the course of 1997might have left Italy's official debt looking higher at the end of that yearthan it did at the end of 1996. This could have seriously undermined thecountry's bid to enter the eurozone. The Treasury therefore needed to keep the formal calculation of its debtconsistent by realising their exchange rate gain during the lifetime of thebond. Both the exchange rate and the interest rate of the swap contract werestructured to allow this. Treasury officials say the 30 per cent foreign exchange gain from the Y200bnbond was highly unusual. They dismissed any notion that this could be aregular phenomenon in debt management as absurd. Nor, say officials, could the swap be judged as a way of ""window dressing""the deficit figure. If window dressing had taken place, Italy would haveseen its deficit and debt shoot up after it had successfully entered thesingle currency. The fact remains that Italy's deficit and debt have bothbeen on a steadily downward path since 1996.Rome 'did not cheat over deficit' Financial Times - November 6, 2001 (European Edition)By Peter NormanThe European Commission and Eurostat, the European Union's statisticalagency, yesterday rejected suggestions that Italy had used theover-the-counter derivatives market to camouflage the true size of itsbudget deficit and so help its admission to the European single currency. Gerassimos Thomas, spokesman for Pedro Solbes, the economic and monetaryaffairs commissioner, said the Commission's preliminary evaluation was thatthe use of interest rate swap transactions by one member state in 1997, ashighlighted in an International Securities Market Association (ISMA) report,did not amount to cheating on the budget deficit figures. Mr. Thomas said the purpose of such swap transactions was to save money forgovernments and they were therefore not discouraged by regulators. Althoughthe ISMA report referred only to an unnamed member state, it was understoodto be Italy. Yves Franchet, the director-general of Eurostat, said his agency knew in1997 about the Y200bn Italian bond issue and swap transaction mentionedanonymously in the report. The effect of that deal was to reduce Italy'sdeficit of around 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1997 by amarginal 0.02 percentage points. The swap deal was therefore not of a size to influence significantly Italy'sability to produce a deficit well below the 3 per cent ceiling set in theMaastricht Treaty. Mr. Franchet said Eurostat consulted widely on how to treat swaps beforedefining the deficit of Italy and other member states. The agency had towork out the public deficits of member states for economic and monetaryunion at a time of statistical transition between national accounts based ona standard known as ESA79, which took no account of swaps, and before formaladoption of the ESA95 system, which recognised swaps. After consulting with expert committees, Eurostat decided to apply the ESA95standard in calculating member states' suitability for Emu. Aware that swapscould have a positive or negative effect on deficits, Eurostat alsoconducted a survey of swap use by member states. According to Mr. Franchet,the practice was not widespread. Cavallo defends Argentina's plan for debt swap Financial Times - November 6, 2001By Thomas CatanDomingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday mounted a defenceof his country's controversial debt swap plan, saying investors must acceptlower interest payments if his country was to avoid an outright default onits Dollars 132bn debt. ""Any reasonable person knows that Argentina cannot grow if it has to payinterest on its debt that ranges between 11 per cent to 25 per cent - and inthe case of some provinces, up to 30 per cent a year,"" he told an audienceof businessmen. ""We . . . seek to ensure payment on the basis that Argentina is viable andto stop trying to pay (interest rates) that only reflect the march ofArgentina towards default. It's a question of telling the truth."" Starting today, Argentina will offer private creditors new bonds backed byfuture tax revenues that will pay a maximum of 7 per cent. Repayment onbonds coming due in the next 10 years will also be pushed forward by threeyears, Mr. Cavallo said. This leg of the debt restructuring appears to be aimed mainly at domesticinvestors - local pension funds, insurance companies and banks - that holdat least a third of Argentina's Dollars 95bn in bonds. These localinstitutions, often units of international banks, are heavily exposed toArgentine debt and are seen as more susceptible to government pressure. A second ""global exchange"" for all of Argentina's bonds should be readywithin 2-4 months, Mr. Cavallo said.

Italy rebuts claims over swap contract
Financial Times (North American Edition) - November 5, 2001
By James Blitz 

The Italian Treasury firmly rebutted allegations on Monday that it had
structured a complicated swaps contract with the aim of deflating its 1997
budget deficit figure and qualifying for the single European currency. 

In a formal statement, the Treasury said that swap contracts - in which a
bond issuer can trade his obligation to make payments in one currency rather
than another - were a regular method of ""improving management of public
debt"". 

Privately, meanwhile, Treasury officials sought to explain why Italy had
undertaken a swap contract highlighted over the weekend by a report for the
International Securities Market Association. 

On May 15 1995 the Italian government issued a bond for Y200bn. At the time,
after the dramatic 1992 devaluation of the lira, the Italian Treasury was
gradually seeking to regain credibility in international markets, and did so
by issuing bonds in a range of currencies. 

When the Y200bn bond was issued, the yen-lira exchange rate was at L19.3. By
December 1996, however, the yen had depreciated by 30 per cent to a level of
L13.4 to the yen. The Treasury then sought to lock in its currency gains
over this period. 

Treasury officials say they could have undertaken to start buying back the
Y200bn bond issue, but given its sheer size, this was unrealistic. They
therefore decided to undertake a cross-currency swap in which the Treasury
could convert its yen liabilities into lira. 

The Treasury faced a serious technical problem, however. Under European
Union statistical rules pertaining at the time, the debt of all EU countries
could only be reported in the original currency in which the bonds had been
issued, in this case yen. 

Any swap contract agreed by the Treasury in order to close its foreign
exchange risk would thus be irrelevant when it came to calculating the
overall debt figure. 

This was highly pertinent to how the swap agreement had to be structured. 

The Italian Treasury could have simply closed the swap transaction when the
Y200bn bond matured in September 1998, realising all its exchange rate gains
at that date. But a strong appreciation of the yen during the course of 1997
might have left Italy's official debt looking higher at the end of that year
than it did at the end of 1996. This could have seriously undermined the
country's bid to enter the eurozone. 

The Treasury therefore needed to keep the formal calculation of its debt
consistent by realising their exchange rate gain during the lifetime of the
bond. Both the exchange rate and the interest rate of the swap contract were
structured to allow this. 

Treasury officials say the 30 per cent foreign exchange gain from the Y200bn
bond was highly unusual. They dismissed any notion that this could be a
regular phenomenon in debt management as absurd. 

Nor, say officials, could the swap be judged as a way of ""window dressing""
the deficit figure. If window dressing had taken place, Italy would have
seen its deficit and debt shoot up after it had successfully entered the
single currency. The fact remains that Italy's deficit and debt have both
been on a steadily downward path since 1996.

Rome 'did not cheat over deficit' 
Financial Times - November 6, 2001 (European Edition)
By Peter Norman

The European Commission and Eurostat, the European Union's statistical
agency, yesterday rejected suggestions that Italy had used the
over-the-counter derivatives market to camouflage the true size of its
budget deficit and so help its admission to the European single currency. 

Gerassimos Thomas, spokesman for Pedro Solbes, the economic and monetary
affairs commissioner, said the Commission's preliminary evaluation was that
the use of interest rate swap transactions by one member state in 1997, as
highlighted in an International Securities Market Association (ISMA) report,
did not amount to cheating on the budget deficit figures. 

Mr. Thomas said the purpose of such swap transactions was to save money for
governments and they were therefore not discouraged by regulators. Although
the ISMA report referred only to an unnamed member state, it was understood
to be Italy. 

Yves Franchet, the director-general of Eurostat, said his agency knew in
1997 about the Y200bn Italian bond issue and swap transaction mentioned
anonymously in the report. The effect of that deal was to reduce Italy's
deficit of around 2.7 per cent of gross domestic product in 1997 by a
marginal 0.02 percentage points. 

The swap deal was therefore not of a size to influence significantly Italy's
ability to produce a deficit well below the 3 per cent ceiling set in the
Maastricht Treaty. 

Mr. Franchet said Eurostat consulted widely on how to treat swaps before
defining the deficit of Italy and other member states. The agency had to
work out the public deficits of member states for economic and monetary
union at a time of statistical transition between national accounts based on
a standard known as ESA79, which took no account of swaps, and before formal
adoption of the ESA95 system, which recognised swaps. 

After consulting with expert committees, Eurostat decided to apply the ESA95
standard in calculating member states' suitability for Emu. Aware that swaps
could have a positive or negative effect on deficits, Eurostat also
conducted a survey of swap use by member states. According to Mr. Franchet,
the practice was not widespread. 

Cavallo defends Argentina's plan for debt swap 
Financial Times - November 6, 2001
By Thomas Catan

Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, yesterday mounted a defence
of his country's controversial debt swap plan, saying investors must accept
lower interest payments if his country was to avoid an outright default on
its Dollars 132bn debt. 

""Any reasonable person knows that Argentina cannot grow if it has to pay
interest on its debt that ranges between 11 per cent to 25 per cent - and in
the case of some provinces, up to 30 per cent a year,"" he told an audience
of businessmen. 

""We . . . seek to ensure payment on the basis that Argentina is viable and
to stop trying to pay (interest rates) that only reflect the march of
Argentina towards default. It's a question of telling the truth."" 

Starting today, Argentina will offer private creditors new bonds backed by
future tax revenues that will pay a maximum of 7 per cent. Repayment on
bonds coming due in the next 10 years will also be pushed forward by three
years, Mr. Cavallo said. 

This leg of the debt restructuring appears to be aimed mainly at domestic
investors - local pension funds, insurance companies and banks - that hold
at least a third of Argentina's Dollars 95bn in bonds. These local
institutions, often units of international banks, are heavily exposed to
Argentine debt and are seen as more susceptible to government pressure. 

A second ""global exchange"" for all of Argentina's bonds should be ready
within 2-4 months, Mr. Cavallo said. By then, Argentine officials hope to
have additional guarantees from multilateral lending agencies to offer
foreign investors in return for accepting lower-interest bonds. Argentina
hopes this will enable it to avoid an outright default on its debt. 

Investors entering the first, mainly local, exchange will be entitled to
enter any subsequent deal, Mr. Cavallo said. Pension fund managers had
feared being taken to court by future retirees for having acted against
their interests. 

""Those who have confidence in Argentina are going to have two opportunities
because no one knows if the global exchange will have better or worse
terms,"" Mr. Cavallo said. 

Argentina is attempting to cut its annual interest bill by at least Dollars
4bn to free up resources to restart its ailing economy, now in its fourth
year of recession. To do so, the government is implementing a range of tax
cuts and other measures to spark spending, such as cutting employees'
private pension contributions. 

Investors remain concerned that Argentina's debt proposal effectively
constitutes a default. However, Mr. Cavallo is now putting them on notice
that they must accept lower interest payments if the country is to continue
to service its debt.  The government is also pressing the 23 provinces to
accept a cut in their guaranteed monthly tax transfers.

JEAN-FRANCOIS THEODORE, the head of Euronext, is a surprise winner. The
London Stock Exchange (LSE) was widely expected to triumph in the bidding
for Liffe, London's derivatives exchange. Yet on October 29th the board of

Although the municipalization of an incumbent utility's elec=tric system is not a new concept-either nationally or in this particular ca=se-San Francisco is presently the largest city in which such efforts are be=ing considered. Given the relative success of other municipalized electric =systems in California (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacram=ento Municipal Utility District, for instance), along with the bad publicit=y that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has encountered over the last year due to= the state's energy crisis and its own bankruptcy proceedings, today's vote= could very well be a victory for public power. The vote in and of itself w=ill not create a municipalized electric system in San Francisco. Pacific Ga=s & Electric Co. has already vowed to fight the takeover, and if the vote i=s a win for public power it will only lead to further lengthy and costly co=urt battles. However, the vote is significant because it illustrates what a=ppears to be a growing trend among cities that believe they can provide che=aper electric service than incumbent, for-profit utilities. In addition, th=e measure is just one more strike against the already beleaguered Pacific G=as & Electric Co., which is still navigating through bankruptcy proceedings=.=20There are two measures related to the public power movement that are up for= vote in San Francisco today. First, Proposition I would create a San Franc=isco-Brisbane Municipal Utility District (MUD), an independent agency gover=ned by a five-member board that would provide electric service to San Franc=isco and Brisbane, Calif., a smaller city located to the south of the Bay A=rea. California law requires that two separate cities be included in order =for municipalization to take effect, and thus from the onset of the municip=alization discussions in this area San Francisco and Brisbane were grouped =together as one district. The second measure up for vote, known as Proposit=ion F, would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and reta=in ties to City Hall. This measure would not create a MUD and therefore wou=ld not need to include Brisbane to take effect. The agency would be governe=d by an elected seven-member board of directors and would replace the curre=nt jurisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission.==20An affirmative vote in either or both of the measures would not necessarily= mean an immediate effort to take over Pacific Gas & Electric's infrastruct=ure. In addition to the court appeals that would undoubtedly take place, in= the event of either measure being passed an elected board would have to su=bsequently vote whether or not to seize the utility's transmission and dist=ribution lines. If such a vote were approved, the MUD could use eminent dom=ain to take over the utility's assets.=20Ultimately at stake is a battle over Pacific Gas & Electric's 4.7 million c=ustomers and its transmission system, which has been appraised between $750= million and $1 billion (the utility claims that its system is worth $1.5 b=illion). Both sides have argued decidedly different platforms. The pro-muni= effort in San Francisco / Brisbane has been led by Bruce Brugmann, the pub=lisher of the Bay Guardian newspaper and City Supervisors Angela Alioto and= Tom Ammiano. The proponents of the muni measure argue that a utility distr=ict operating as a nonprofit public entity would be more beneficial to city= residents than a dividend-paying division of a major energy firm. It has b=een repeatedly noted by the pro-muni forces that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.= charges the third-highest electric rates in the United States. In addition=, the proponents point to already-established municipalized districts in Ca=lifornia such as LADWP and SMUD, which they claim have protected customers =from increasingly volatile prices for electricity. The other tenets of the =pro-muni argument are that public power would lead to better accountability= to customers and more emphasis on renewable energy.=20The movement against the muni effort is obviously led by Pacific Gas & Elec=tric Co., but also includes officials from AT&T and Pacific Telesis Group, =which together contributed about $250,000 to the opposition effort. Apparen=tly, local communications companies fear that a successful municipalization= effort of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. would lead to similar takeover measur=es in the phone industry. The basic argument against the public power movem=ent is that the plan is unrealistic. Specifically, opponents say, the MUD f=ormed by San Francisco and Brisbane would be ill-equipped to handle the com=plex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & Electric has effectively= managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be able to co=mpete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD would have t=o purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also buy wholes=ale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which represent two h=efty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run. It is= true that the city of San Francisco owns the dam at Hetch Hetchy reservoir=, which powers street lights and city offices with hydropower. However, the= reservoir is reportedly in great need for maintenance and may require addi=tional capital for upgrades. Thus, in order to serve Pacific Gas & Electric='s 4.7 million customers, the MUD would have to buy most of its power on th=e wholesale market.=20This is actually one of several important points that may not have been tak=en into full consideration by the pro-muni forces. Already-established MUDs= in California such as LADWP and SMUD, and those in other states, have alre=ady established lucrative contracts to obtain federal power at cheap rates =through 2004. There is a good chance that a San Francisco / Brisbane MUD wo=uld not have the same opportunity to secure the same rates at this juncture=. Thus, without the benefit of long-term contracts, the San Francisco / Bri=sbane MUD could be exposed to the volatile wholesale market or be forced to= invest in the construction of expensive power plants. Often, such costs ge=t overlooked when a city is planning to municipalize. In fact, it has been =reported that the pro-muni side in this particular case did not conduct any= feasibility study in advance of its campaign, and thus could very well be =unaware of these associated costs. However, S. David Freeman, who previousl=y managed LADWP and was recently appointed chairman of the new California C=onsumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, went on record stating =that his organization could assist a public power agency in San Francisco b=y selling it low-cost electricity produced by plants financed by the author=ity.=20As noted, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. intends to fight the municipalization =effort, and in fact has fought in City Hall and in court for decades to der=ail such efforts in San Francisco. However, in contrast with past battles, =the issue has become more intensely politicized over the last year as San F=ranciscans faced rolling blackouts and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. went bank=rupt. The utility recently received cash support from its parent PG&E Corp.=, which reportedly spent about $1 million in an advertising campaign urging= citizens to vote against the public power initiative. This financial suppo=rt has been helpful, considering that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is current=ly in bankruptcy proceedings and has little capital to front its own defens=e against the muni effort. Consequently, if voters pass the measures on Nov=. 6, PG&E Corp. will undoubtedly launch a lengthy court battle that will ke=ep the issue in litigation for years. In addition to the court appeals, it =would most likely take the newly formed MUD years to gather the capital nee=ded to front a purchase of Pacific Gas & Electric's T&D assets.=20Nevertheless, an affirmative vote on the muni issue could set a precedent f=or future votes and perhaps mark the dawn of a new era for public power. Ot=her California cities such as San Diego, San Jose and Davis are closely fol=lowing the outcome in San Francisco as they have also debated the issue of =municipalization. In addition, the Coachella Valley Association of Governme=nts, which includes the city of Palm Springs, Calif., began looking at the =feasibility of taking over Southern California Edison's distribution system= and forming a municipal utility last September. In fact, the municipalizat=ion effort has gained some momentum across the country over the last few ye=ars, along with the opening of competitive markets through deregulation. Cu=rrent reports indicate that there are about 2,000 public electric districts=, providing electric power to 40 million customers and accounting for 15 pe=rcent of the demand in the United States. It is important to note that the =majority of these public power districts were formed in the early 1900s.=20The turnout for the vote in San Francisco could be a deciding factor. Altho=ugh the issue had been gaining momentum in the city earlier this year, the =events of Sept. 11 have turned the focus to more national events and made p=eople wary of change. Typically, voter turnout in the area is around 35 per=cent. A recent survey conducted by the opponents of the measure found that =35 percent of those surveyed favored passage, 30 percent oppose it, and 35 =percent were undecided.=20It is important to note that municipalization is not an issue that is only =facing California. After several years of discussions, lawsuits and negotia=tions, the city of Hermiston, Ore., voted to spend $8 million to purchase t=he facilities PacifiCorp has been using to serve 4,000 commercial and resid=ential customers. The city of Hermiston began serving customers on Oct. 1, =when a new contract with Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) took effect.= The federal power-marketing agency has already set aside 12 MW for the cit=y, after determining that Hermiston qualified as a new small public utility= eligible for preference power.=20Hermiston, Ore., is the first city to complete a contested municipalization= of an incumbent utility's electric business in two decades (the last signi=ficant contested municipalization was completed in Massena, N.Y., in 1981).= Despite the fact that a growing number of U.S. cities have expressed inter=est in municipalizing their electric systems, for the most part such effort=s remain overwhelmingly unsuccessful when taken to court or a public ballot=. Despite the success of Hermiston, some 50 other municipalization efforts =have been terminated during the 30 years between 1970 and 2000. For instanc=e, the city of Wichita, Kansas, spent more than $300,000 in the past two ye=ars studying municipal power options. However, after the Kansas Corporation= Commission turned down Western Resources' proposed rate hike this summer, =the city put municipalization plans on hold. Thus, the eyes of the industry= will remain on the vote today in San Francisco for any indication that mun=icipalization efforts are gaining momentum and proving successful.=20TOMORROW'S ISSUEALERT WILL INCLUDE THE OUTCOME OF THE MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE= IN SAN FRANCISCO.=20An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available atwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20  _____ =20We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

Munipalization Vote in San Francisco May Set Precedent







By Will McNamara

Director, Electric Industry Analysis





[News item from Associated Press] In the wake of this year's California pow=

er woes, votes in the hometown of the state's largest utility will decide o=

n Nov. 6 whether to initiate action to seize Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s l=

ocal electricity network and deliver power through a public agency.=20



Analysis: There is a lot riding on today's vote, and its outcome will undou=

btedly have significant ramifications for California and other cities acros=

s the country. Although the municipalization of an incumbent utility's elec=

tric system is not a new concept-either nationally or in this particular ca=

se-San Francisco is presently the largest city in which such efforts are be=

ing considered. Given the relative success of other municipalized electric =

systems in California (Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and Sacram=

ento Municipal Utility District, for instance), along with the bad publicit=

y that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has encountered over the last year due to=

 the state's energy crisis and its own bankruptcy proceedings, today's vote=

 could very well be a victory for public power. The vote in and of itself w=

ill not create a municipalized electric system in San Francisco. Pacific Ga=

s & Electric Co. has already vowed to fight the takeover, and if the vote i=

s a win for public power it will only lead to further lengthy and costly co=

urt battles. However, the vote is significant because it illustrates what a=

ppears to be a growing trend among cities that believe they can provide che=

aper electric service than incumbent, for-profit utilities. In addition, th=

e measure is just one more strike against the already beleaguered Pacific G=

as & Electric Co., which is still navigating through bankruptcy proceedings=

.=20



There are two measures related to the public power movement that are up for=

 vote in San Francisco today. First, Proposition I would create a San Franc=

isco-Brisbane Municipal Utility District (MUD), an independent agency gover=

ned by a five-member board that would provide electric service to San Franc=

isco and Brisbane, Calif., a smaller city located to the south of the Bay A=

rea. California law requires that two separate cities be included in order =

for municipalization to take effect, and thus from the onset of the municip=

alization discussions in this area San Francisco and Brisbane were grouped =

together as one district. The second measure up for vote, known as Proposit=

ion F, would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and reta=

in ties to City Hall. This measure would not create a MUD and therefore wou=

ld not need to include Brisbane to take effect. The agency would be governe=

d by an elected seven-member board of directors and would replace the curre=

nt jurisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission.=

=20



An affirmative vote in either or both of the measures would not necessarily=

 mean an immediate effort to take over Pacific Gas & Electric's infrastruct=

ure. In addition to the court appeals that would undoubtedly take place, in=

 the event of either measure being passed an elected board would have to su=

bsequently vote whether or not to seize the utility's transmission and dist=

ribution lines. If such a vote were approved, the MUD could use eminent dom=

ain to take over the utility's assets.=20



Ultimately at stake is a battle over Pacific Gas & Electric's 4.7 million c=

ustomers and its transmission system, which has been appraised between $750=

 million and $1 billion (the utility claims that its system is worth $1.5 b=

illion). Both sides have argued decidedly different platforms. The pro-muni=

 effort in San Francisco / Brisbane has been led by Bruce Brugmann, the pub=

lisher of the Bay Guardian newspaper and City Supervisors Angela Alioto and=

 Tom Ammiano. The proponents of the muni measure argue that a utility distr=

ict operating as a nonprofit public entity would be more beneficial to city=

 residents than a dividend-paying division of a major energy firm. It has b=

een repeatedly noted by the pro-muni forces that Pacific Gas & Electric Co.=

 charges the third-highest electric rates in the United States. In addition=

, the proponents point to already-established municipalized districts in Ca=

lifornia such as LADWP and SMUD, which they claim have protected customers =

from increasingly volatile prices for electricity. The other tenets of the =

pro-muni argument are that public power would lead to better accountability=

 to customers and more emphasis on renewable energy.=20



The movement against the muni effort is obviously led by Pacific Gas & Elec=

tric Co., but also includes officials from AT&T and Pacific Telesis Group, =

which together contributed about $250,000 to the opposition effort. Apparen=

tly, local communications companies fear that a successful municipalization=

 effort of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. would lead to similar takeover measur=

es in the phone industry. The basic argument against the public power movem=

ent is that the plan is unrealistic. Specifically, opponents say, the MUD f=

ormed by San Francisco and Brisbane would be ill-equipped to handle the com=

plex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & Electric has effectively=

 managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be able to co=

mpete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD would have t=

o purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also buy wholes=

ale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which represent two h=

efty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long run. It is=

 true that the city of San Francisco owns the dam at Hetch Hetchy reservoir=

, which powers street lights and city offices with hydropower. However, the=

 reservoir is reportedly in great need for maintenance and may require addi=

tional capital for upgrades. Thus, in order to serve Pacific Gas & Electric=

's 4.7 million customers, the MUD would have to buy most of its power on th=

e wholesale market.=20



This is actually one of several important points that may not have been tak=

en into full consideration by the pro-muni forces. Already-established MUDs=

 in California such as LADWP and SMUD, and those in other states, have alre=

ady established lucrative contracts to obtain federal power at cheap rates =

through 2004. There is a good chance that a San Francisco / Brisbane MUD wo=

uld not have the same opportunity to secure the same rates at this juncture=

. Thus, without the benefit of long-term contracts, the San Francisco / Bri=

sbane MUD could be exposed to the volatile wholesale market or be forced to=

 invest in the construction of expensive power plants. Often, such costs ge=

t overlooked when a city is planning to municipalize. In fact, it has been =

reported that the pro-muni side in this particular case did not conduct any=

 feasibility study in advance of its campaign, and thus could very well be =

unaware of these associated costs. However, S. David Freeman, who previousl=

y managed LADWP and was recently appointed chairman of the new California C=

onsumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority, went on record stating =

that his organization could assist a public power agency in San Francisco b=

y selling it low-cost electricity produced by plants financed by the author=

ity.=20



As noted, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. intends to fight the municipalization =

effort, and in fact has fought in City Hall and in court for decades to der=

ail such efforts in San Francisco. However, in contrast with past battles, =

the issue has become more intensely politicized over the last year as San F=

ranciscans faced rolling blackouts and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. went bank=

rupt. The utility recently received cash support from its parent PG&E Corp.=

, which reportedly spent about $1 million in an advertising campaign urging=

 citizens to vote against the public power initiative. This financial suppo=

rt has been helpful, considering that Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is current=

ly in bankruptcy proceedings and has little capital to front its own defens=

e against the muni effort. Consequently, if voters pass the measures on Nov=

. 6, PG&E Corp. will undoubtedly launch a lengthy court battle that will ke=

ep the issue in litigation for years. In addition to the court appeals, it =

would most likely take the newly formed MUD years to gather the capital nee=

ded to front a purchase of Pacific Gas & Electric's T&D assets.=20



Nevertheless, an affirmative vote on the muni issue could set a precedent f=

or future votes and perhaps mark the dawn of a new era for public power. Ot=

her California cities such as San Diego, San Jose and Davis are closely fol=

lowing the outcome in San Francisco as they have also debated the issue of =

municipalization. In addition, the Coachella Valley Association of Governme=

nts, which includes the city of Palm Springs, Calif., began looking at the =

feasibility of taking over Southern California Edison's distribution system=

 and forming a municipal utility last September. In fact, the municipalizat=

ion effort has gained some momentum across the country over the last few ye=

ars, along with the opening of competitive markets through deregulation. Cu=

rrent reports indicate that there are about 2,000 public electric districts=

, providing electric power to 40 million customers and accounting for 15 pe=

rcent of the demand in the United States. It is important to note that the =

majority of these public power districts were formed in the early 1900s.=20



The turnout for the vote in San Francisco could be a deciding factor. Altho=

ugh the issue had been gaining momentum in the city earlier this year, the =

events of Sept. 11 have turned the focus to more national events and made p=

eople wary of change. Typically, voter turnout in the area is around 35 per=

cent. A recent survey conducted by the opponents of the measure found that =

35 percent of those surveyed favored passage, 30 percent oppose it, and 35 =

percent were undecided.=20



It is important to note that municipalization is not an issue that is only =

facing California. After several years of discussions, lawsuits and negotia=

tions, the city of Hermiston, Ore., voted to spend $8 million to purchase t=

he facilities PacifiCorp has been using to serve 4,000 commercial and resid=

ential customers. The city of Hermiston began serving customers on Oct. 1, =

when a new contract with Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) took effect.=

 The federal power-marketing agency has already set aside 12 MW for the cit=

y, after determining that Hermiston qualified as a new small public utility=

 eligible for preference power.=20



Hermiston, Ore., is the first city to complete a contested municipalization=

 of an incumbent utility's electric business in two decades (the last signi=

ficant contested municipalization was completed in Massena, N.Y., in 1981).=

 Despite the fact that a growing number of U.S. cities have expressed inter=

est in municipalizing their electric systems, for the most part such effort=

s remain overwhelmingly unsuccessful when taken to court or a public ballot=

. Despite the success of Hermiston, some 50 other municipalization efforts =

have been terminated during the 30 years between 1970 and 2000. For instanc=

e, the city of Wichita, Kansas, spent more than $300,000 in the past two ye=

ars studying municipal power options. However, after the Kansas Corporation=

 Commission turned down Western Resources' proposed rate hike this summer, =

the city put municipalization plans on hold. Thus, the eyes of the industry=

 will remain on the vote today in San Francisco for any indication that mun=

icipalization efforts are gaining momentum and proving successful.=20

He will also oversee ISDA's market survey and will work toproduce surveys in other areas.Over the past several years, Mengle assisted ISDA by conducting derivativesoperations and documentation seminars and he will continue his involvementin this area, ISDA said.""David brings an enormous amount of industry and academic experience toISDA,"" said Robert Pickel, ISDA's executive director and CEO.""His expertise in risk management, derivatives products and regulation willstrengthen ISDA's mission to encourage the prudent and efficient developmentof the privately negotiated derivatives business,"" Pickel said in thestatementMengle was most recently with the consulting firm Rutter Associates.Previously, he was a vice president at J.P. Morgan and worked on a number ofpolicy and capital related issues. Prior to that, he was a researcheconomist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.David Mengle Appointed ISDA Head of ResearchISDA Press Release - November 26, 2001www.isda.org/press/press112601.html<http://www.isda.org/press/press112601.html>ISDA Appoints Head of Research Risk News - November 27, 2001www.risknews.com <http://www.risknews.com>CREDIT DERIVATIVES	*	End-users Build Up Experience - IFRREGULATORY	*	Treasury's Bair: Congress Should Pass Netting Laws This Year- Dow Jones	*	Momentum Builds For US Derivatives Insolvency Bill - DowJones	*	German regulator may follow US - Financial TimesRISK MANAGEMENT	*	UK's FSA Consults On Implications Of Basel Accord Delay -Dow Jones	*	ISDA Names Mengle To New Position As Head Of Research - ISDAPress Release	*	ISDA Appoints Head of Research - Risk NewsEnd-users Build Up ExperienceIFR - November 24, 2001End-users of credit derivatives in the US and Canada are trading an averageof 65 deals a year and make use of with six to seven traders on average,according to a report released last week by consultant Greenwich Associates.""The larger the user, the more dealers they are using,"" said Peter D'Amario,principal at Greenwich and one of the authors.The multiple points of contact, though they complicate documentation forend-users, indicate that end-users are learning and triangulating what theyare hearing, D'Amario said. As credit derivatives are still a relatively newmarket, this strategy may assist users in benefiting from pricedifferentials.

End-users Build Up Experience
IFR - November 24, 2001

End-users of credit derivatives in the US and Canada are trading an average
of 65 deals a year and make use of with six to seven traders on average,
according to a report released last week by consultant Greenwich Associates.
""The larger the user, the more dealers they are using,"" said Peter D'Amario,
principal at Greenwich and one of the authors.

The multiple points of contact, though they complicate documentation for
end-users, indicate that end-users are learning and triangulating what they
are hearing, D'Amario said. As credit derivatives are still a relatively new
market, this strategy may assist users in benefiting from price
differentials. ""They are still concerned enough to go around and talk with
people,"" he added.

The largest and most sophisticated users of credit derivatives report an
average of 150 trades a year, according to the report. Banks were the
biggest users of credit derivatives in terms of volume. Reinsurers and
insurers, fund mangers and hedge funds, in that order, filled in the ranking
of users, said D'Amario, noting that corporates ranked last on the list of
users.

About one-third of the corporates interviewed for the survey said they did
not use credit derivatives. However, no other grouping is looking so
aggressively at becoming involved in the market in the future. Roughly half
of the corporates not currently using credit derivatives stated an intention
to use them within the next year. The inter-dealer market was excluded from
the survey.

""Although [end-users] are using six or seven dealers, they are giving 80% of
their business to three of their top dealers. The other three or four are
fighting for 20% of the business,"" said D'Amario.

""That's unsustainable. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a contraction in
the average number of dealing relationships."" Firms that do not offer a
broad product array may be knocked out first. Greenwich said the dealers
that fare best in its rankings are those that offer a depth and breadth of
relationships, product knowledge, structuring ability and an understanding
of client needs, D'Amario said.

About 40% of end-users cited a relationship as a reason for picking a
dealer, though 53% listed competitive quotes as their top reason for
selecting a dealer. ""When we asked people that, right off the bat they say
competitive quotes. Then, we derive from data what [it is that] correlates
with being one of a user's top three dealers. It is never competitive
quotes. The real reason for selecting a dealer is relationships,"" D'Amario

Treasury's Bair: Congress Should Pass Netting Laws This Year
Dow Jones - November 26, 2001
By Rebecca Christie

A senior Treasury official said Friday that Congress should find a way to
pass so-called netting legislation, even if more broad-based bankruptcy
legislation stalls.

Sheila Bair, assistant secretary for financial institutions, told an
American Bar Association committee that there was an immediate need for the
proposal, which would make it easier for banks and businesses to settle
financial contracts if one of the parties becomes insolvent.

""The relevant provisions are a non-controversial portion of broader
legislation to revise the bankruptcy laws. We are concerned, however, that
the controversial issues of the broader legislation may not be resolved soon
enough to allow its passage this year,"" Bair said.

The proposed changes would limit market disruptions in the event of
insolvency and also reduce the risks to federally regulated participants and
to the overall financial system, Bair said.

""Whether as part of comprehensive bankruptcy reform legislation or as a
stand-alone bill, we believe that Congress should enact netting legislation
this year. Further delays would unnecessarily place the financial system at
greater risk,"" Bair said.

Momentum Builds For US Derivatives Insolvency Bill
Dow Jones - November 26, 2001
By Dawn Kopecki

The nation's leading securities trading groups urged congressional leaders
Tuesday to pass legislation that allows financial institutions and
corporations to close out their derivatives contracts during an insolvency.

""The current economic climate, worsened by the tragedy of Sept. 11, has made
passage of these provisions...critical to the systemic risk reduction given
the combination of market disruption and economic uncertainty,"" reads a
letter sent Tuesday to House and Senate leaders from The Bond Market
Association, The Financial Services Roundtable, International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, the Futures Industry Association and a half dozen
other financial organizations.

Pressure to pass the legislation has mounted since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks shut down U.S. financial markets and destroyed the Manhattan offices
of many Wall Street brokerage houses.

Even though no company went under as a result of the market disruption, the
fear of institutional failures has grown, and support is mounting for
passing the provision apart from the controversial bankruptcy bill to which
it is attached.

The measure allows institutions to quickly close outstanding derivatives
with bankrupt trading partners by netting all the losses and gains of
individual contracts into one deal.

""Congress should not fail to enact netting legislation this year,"" Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill wrote
House lawmakers last month. ""Further delays would unnecessarily place the
financial system at greater risk.""

But congressional support for tightening U.S. bankruptcy laws has dwindled
in the face of a probable recession. As a result, Rep. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.,
introduced the netting measure as its own bill in the House last week.

""Although we support passage of these provisions as part of the larger
bankruptcy-reform legislation....we share concerns of the key financial
regulators that broader (bankruptcy) legislation may not be resolved soon
enough to allow passage this year,"" the trade groups wrote. ""We urge you and
your leadership team to pass (netting legislation) as quickly as possible so
that we do not miss an opportunity for enactment this year.""

German regulator may follow US 
Financial Times - November 27, 2001
By Bertrand Benoit

The integration of European capital markets means Germany's securities
regulator will need to model itself increasingly on the US Securities and
Exchange Commission, according to Georg Wittich, the German authority's
chairman.

""One should examine whether the SEC might not be the appropriate structure
for securities regulation in the future,"" Mr Wittich said in an interview.

""We will have to go towards more centralisation at the German level as the
need arises for increased co-operation between reg-ulators at the European
level.""

Created in 1994, the Frankfurt-based Federal Supervisory Office for
Securities Trading, or BAWe, is one of the few financial markets regulators
in Europe not to act as supervisor for the stock exchange. For historical
reasons, this responsibility lies with the government of the state of Hesse.

Although BAWe is responsible for overseeing companies' official
announcements to financial market participants, it has no power to
investigate suspected cases of market manipulation and no authority to
approve share offer prospectuses if they are linked to a public listing.

While it is mandated to investigate insider trading, the authority has no
right to sue or sanction offenders. Instead, it must transfer all suspected
cases to a public prosecutor for criminal investigation. In practice, few
insider-trading cases ever reach court.

exchange.

UK's FSA Consults On Implications Of Basel Accord Delay
Dow Jones - November 27, 2001
By Sarah Turner

The U.K.'s financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, said
Tuesday that it has set out for consultation the implications of a one-year
delay to the revised Basel Capital Accord on integrated prudential
supervision for U.K. financial firms.

The new Basel Accord framework is intended to improve the safety and
soundness of the financial system by placing more emphasis on banking
internal controls and management, the supervisory review process and market
discipline.  These international initiatives have been delayed until at
least the start of 2005.

The FSA's director of prudential standards, Clive Briault, said the FSA was
previously planning to implement its integrated prudential sourcebook at the
start of 2004, in line with the implementation of the new Basel Accord and
related new European Union legislation.

Briault said ""we believe that we should not defer all the benefits of
integrated regulation simply on account of the delays in international
discussions.""  He added that ""our preferred option is to implement as much
as possible of the sourcebook early in 2004, while deferring those parts
which will or may have to be changed significantly as a result of the
international discussions.""

Key candidates for implementation in 2004 are sourcebook provisions relating
to insurance companies, Lloyds insurance and friendly societies.  Briault
said other areas suitable for early implementation are systems and controls,
investment firms not covered by the Investment Services Directive,
operational risk and, in part, market risk.

Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do riscogarantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos emesp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao riscodecorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aqueleaplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aqueleaplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??esfinanceiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectosrelativos ?s opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito:I - pol?tica, objetivos e estrat?gias da institui??o;II - processo de gerenciamento de riscos;III - volumes de risco de cr?dito transferidos (valor cont?bil e demercado), total e no per?odo;IV - receitas e/ou despesas no per?odo;V - efeito (aumento/redu??o) no c?lculo do PLE;VI - montante e caracter?sticas das opera??es de cr?ditostransferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradoresprevistos no contrato;VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).Art. 6?

evento de cr?dito.
? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante
de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido
com base na seguinte f?rmula:
FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:
FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo
subjacente;
PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);
PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);
FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo
subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o

PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.
Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do
ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.
Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco
garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em
esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco
decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele
aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele
aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000


The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

""In the immediate aftermath ofthe events of 11 September trade ticket size went down,"" says one broker. ""Alot of people were prepared to make markets in $5m or euros where previouslythe average ticket size was $10-15m. The nominal size of the trade went downas a result of the level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets.""Traders report that credit default swap trade volume soared to three timesthe normal level. ""If nominal ticket value went down by half and tradevolume went up three-fold, overall volumes were up by 5 00/0 in terms of theactual business being written,"" explains the broker.  After the initialshock of the devastating attacks, the market recovered its poise andanalysts and traders soon realised the credits that would be most affected.""Clearly, airline stocks took a pummelling,"" says one trader. ""Prior to theevent, British Airways was trading around 100 basis points for five yeardefault swaps. After the attacks, BA widened dramatically to 350/SOObp.Spreads on this credit did come in from this level, but they have since goneback out again and are currently trading around 380/450bp. Meanwhile, we sawa credit event on Swiss Air, and German airline Lufthansa also went out,with all the European airlines following suit.""Insurance sectorAs was expected, the credit derivatives market also saw heightened activityin the insurance and reinsurance sector. ""There has been a lot of activityaround companies such as Zurich Re,"" says the trader. ""Zurich spreads movedout from around	20/40bp to 50/100bp. The credit did trade towards theoffered side once or twice. Zurich spreads have stayed in this range despitethe fact that the company has downsized its profits and upsized itspredicted loss (effectively doubling the amount of provision) as a result ofthe terrorist attacks.""Similarly, names such as AXA, Agon, and Aliance have all been activelyquoted in the aftermath of 11 September and spreads have widenedconsiderably on these names. For example, as FOW went to press Aliancespreads went out to 7Obp before tracking back in to 35/55bp. In addition,sectors that have not been considered directly affected by the attacks, suchas the auto sector, also moved out as a result of the potential slowdown inthe US.""We have seen principle investors in the credit derivatives market tradingeither with a view or going by what the spot markets are doing,"" says onedealer. ""We have also seen quite a few investors gaining synthetic exposureto bonds by selling default swaps.  Recent weeks have proved a significanttest of the liquidity in the default swaps market. In some areas, the bondmarket was extremely thin and it was difficult to trade. However, withdefault swaps there was always a price in no more than five minutes. Themarket was both traded and tradable.""EuropeThe European credit derivatives market has also had to contend with thedemise of the UK's train operator, Railtrack. ""Railtrack is going to be acredit event on bankruptcy rather than restructuring,"" says one structurer.""There was a thought initially that it would go via restructuring and thatwould have been an interesting test of the modified ISDA restructuringsupplement.

Fitch cut Argentina's credit rating from CCto C, indicating an imminent default, and left it on rating watch negative. ""Although the proposed debt exchange has been described as voluntary, publicstatements by Argentine officials imply that in the absence of such anexchange, public debt held by domestic investors is unlikely to beserviced,"" Fitch said. Fitch also said the terms of the new instruments would be inferior to thoseof existing debt, including lower coupons and longer maturities. However, despite all this, emerging markets remained surprisingly calm withno visible signs of contagion developing. Emerging markets bond spreads hadhardly moved since last Friday's announcement and the yield spread of somecountries, including Brazil, had even tightened. This is because there islittle leverage in the system, compared with the 1998 Russian crisis, andbecause most market participants were prepared for an Argentine default. Several emerging market issuers said they were pressing ahead with bondsdespite Argentina's troubles. Bulgaria is likely to launch its debut euro-denominated international bondnext week.

Sibneft, Russia's oil company, said it would also go ahead witha three-year Dollars 250m bond issue this month, although other oilcompanies have chosen to postpone their issues until next year. Ifsuccessful, Sibneft could become the first Russian corporate to issueinternational bonds since the 1998 crisis. Moody's yesterday assigned Sibneft a rating of B1, a notch above Russia'ssovereign credit rating. Dumping ""W""FOW - November 2001By Jane Douglas-JonesBasel Committee for Banking Supervision has been busy in recent weeks.

In the weeks following the terrorist attacks in the US, credit derivative
traders reported record levels of activity. ""In the immediate aftermath of

the average ticket size was $10-15m. The nominal size of the trade went down
as a result of the level of uncertainty and volatility in the markets.""

Traders report that credit default swap trade volume soared to three times
the normal level. ""If nominal ticket value went down by half and trade
volume went up three-fold, overall volumes were up by 5 00/0 in terms of the

shock of the devastating attacks, the market recovered its poise and
analysts and traders soon realised the credits that would be most affected.

""Clearly, airline stocks took a pummelling,"" says one trader. ""Prior to the

ISDA publishes amendments to master agreements
IFR - November 3, 2001

As part of its effort to improve counter-party risk management practices,
the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last week released nine
amendments that can be added as attachments to ISDA master agreements. Many
of the changes included in the document were inspired by the market
turbulence in 1998, ISDA said. Ultimately, the amendments will form the
basis of an initial draft of a new master agreement.

Using one amendment, a failure to pay becomes a default one local delivery
day after notice of such failure is given to the relevant party. ""Many
market participants found three local business days after notice to be too

Under a second amendment, market participants can use a replacement value
method of valuing transactions after early termination of a master
agreement. The replacement method combines elements of the market quotation

An amendment stating that the occurrence of termination events should be

new list of amendments that may be tacked on to master agreements.
According to ISDA, this option was added because a number of members hold
the view that most termination events are credit-related.

ISDA initiated a review of its master agreements' provisions in 1999. The
process took into account recommendations by the counter-party risk

Emerging market issuers press ahead 
Financial Times - November 7, 2001
By Arkady Ostrovsky

Emerging market borrowers are pressing ahead with planned international bond
issues, despite a deepening debt crisis in Argentina. 

Fitch, the credit rating agency, yesterday said Argentina's planned debt
swap would amount to a default. Fitch cut Argentina's credit rating from CC
to C, indicating an imminent default, and left it on rating watch negative. 

""Although the proposed debt exchange has been described as voluntary, public
statements by Argentine officials imply that in the absence of such an
exchange, public debt held by domestic investors is unlikely to be
serviced,"" Fitch said. 

Fitch also said the terms of the new instruments would be inferior to those
of existing debt, including lower coupons and longer maturities. 

However, despite all this, emerging markets remained surprisingly calm with
no visible signs of contagion developing. Emerging markets bond spreads had
hardly moved since last Friday's announcement and the yield spread of some
countries, including Brazil, had even tightened. This is because there is
little leverage in the system, compared with the 1998 Russian crisis, and
because most market participants were prepared for an Argentine default. 

Several emerging market issuers said they were pressing ahead with bonds
despite Argentina's troubles. 

Bulgaria is likely to launch its debut euro-denominated international bond

Dumping ""W""
FOW - November 2001
By Jane Douglas-Jones

Basel Committee for Banking Supervision has been busy in recent weeks. The
Committee has issued guidance to banks on customer due diligence processes,
reviewed its Internal Ratings Based Approach (EBB) to specialised lending
exposures, and published crucial papers on operational risk and market
discipline. In addition, the credit derivatives market breathed a sign of
relief at the Committee's decision to dump 'w'.
In the first of a series of updates on the proposed new Basel Capital
Accord, the Basel Committee's Capital Group has decided to incorporate the
'w' factor (a residual risk charge for credit derivatives) into pillar two
of the Accord's framework, which deals with the supervisory review process.

This move was welcomed by the banking industry and the International Swaps &
Derivatives Association (ISDA), neither of which has been backward in
expressing disapproval of 'w'. The news that the charge is to be assimilated
elsewhere in the Accord came as no surprise given the uproar since w's birth
in the January 2001 Basel consultative paper. As FOW reported (see May
issue, It's the end of
as we know it, page 21), the charge was derided, at ISDA's AGM, by the very
regulators one would expect to defend it and the future of the 'w' factor
has looked bleak since then.

However, some market participants were worried that the Committee would
stand by the charge both because of the immaturity of the credit derivatives
market and also because of the worry that credit risk management instruments
could be used for regulatory arbitrage. ""Any sign of traders using a
derivative to 'get around' a capital charge or regulation has been, in the
past, punished by conservative and complex rules,"" says one source. ""Recent
evidence of this can be found in the securitisation market.""

The demise of 'w' has not meant the end of regulator concern about credit
derivatives. The Capital Group states: ""One of the Basel Committee's
objectives in considering the treatment of credit derivatives in the trading
book is to minimise the possibility of regulatory arbitrage... the Capital
Group is planning to specify a rule that is already implemented by many
supervisors. This rule provides that when a bank conducts an internal hedge
of a banking book exposure using a credit derivative in its own trading
book, in order to receive any regulatory capital benefit it must transfer
the credit risk to an outside third party (ie an eligible credit protection
provider).""

Meanwhile, the Accord's add-on matrix for potential future exposure
calculations does not explicitly cover credit derivatives and rules differ
across countries. 'The Capital Group is working ~to provide proposals that
will harmonise this treatment.

Op risk
The Risk Management Group
(RMG) of the Basel Committee
has also been hard at work. The Group has made a number of significant
changes to the January proposals including:
	*	Refinement of the definition of operational risk
	*	Proposed reduction in the overall level of the operational
risk capital charge from 200/0 to 120/0
	*	Introduction of a new regulatory capital approach that is
based on banks' internal risk estimates (the ""Advanced Measurement
Approaches"" [AMA])
	*	Consideration of the role of insurance as a risk mitigant in
the regulatory capital calculations.

The Group now defines op risk as ""the risk of loss resulting from inadequate
or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events"".
 
Due diligence
In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the US in September, the Basel
Committee has issued guidance and minimum standards to banks on customer due
diligence processes. ""Systemic customer due diligence is an essential
element of banks' risk management,' says William McDonough, chairman of the
Basel Committee. ""It is critical 'to safeguarding confidence and the
integrity of the banking system. The importance of a rigorous approach has
been underscored by the recent terrorist attacks in the US."" 


Basel Committee, IOSCO, IAIS Publish Cross-Sector Reports
Dow Jones Newswires - November 7, 2001

LONDON -- Two cross-sector reports aimed at supervisors in the banking,
securities and insurance industries were published Wednesday by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision, the technical committee of the
International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International
Association of Insurance Supervisors.

The reports deal with cross-sectoral comparisons of risk management
practices and regulatory capital, and with core principles of the respective
sectors the organizations deal with.

The reports were published by the Joint Forum, established in 1996 to
examine supervisory issues related to financial conglomerates.

(NYSE: FE) closed its merger= with GPU Inc. on Nov. 6 and announced that members of its Board of Directo=rs had been named. The effective date of the merger is Nov. 7, 2001. ""With =today's closing of our merger, we will begin operating as a larger, stronge=r company, better positioned to provide significant benefits to our custome=rs, shareholders and employees,"" said FirstEnergy Chief Executive Officer H=. Peter Burg.Analysis: When compared to 2000 and 1999, 2001 has turned out to be a rathe=r anti-climatic year with regard to merger and acquisition activity in the =energy industry. In fact, when compared to the early days of deregulation, =M&A activity has slowed from a flood to a slow drip. The days of combining =two vertically integrated utility companies to gain scale and guarantee sur=vival appear to be on the decline. Partnerships will still continue, of cou=rse, but they are now of a different breed than before and have become far =more focused on a particular market niche. One exception to the rather unev=entful M&A scoreboard this year is the just-completed $4.2-billion partners=hip between FirstEnergy and GPU, which reportedly will create an electric u=tility serving 4.2 million customers from Toledo, Ohio to the New Jersey sh=ore. The two companies have positioned their partnership as creating the ""p=remier supplier in a 13-state region."" However, while one of the few intere=sting deals this year, the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership has not been witho=ut controversy, especially with regard to lingering financial obligations t=hat GPU has in the Three Mile Island nuclear plant.=20First, let's establish the basics about this partnership. Akron, Ohio-based= FirstEnergy has purchased Morristown, N.J.-based GPU Inc., paying a divide=nd of $0.42392 a share that will be payable on Nov. 28. FirstEnergy-itself =a product of a 1997 merger between Ohio Edison and Centerior Inc. -is alrea=dy an energy services holding company serving 2.2 million customers within =13,200 square miles of northern and central Ohio and western Pennsylvania. =FirstEnergy also provides natural-gas service to approximately 50,000 custo=mers in the Midwest and is involved in the exploration and production of oi=l and natural gas, and the transmission and marketing of natural gas, with =resources that include proven reserves of 450 billion cubic feet equivalent= of natural gas and oil-about 90 percent natural gas-and approximately 5,00=0 miles of pipelines. FirstEnergy also owns 7,500 miles of transmission lin=es, with 35 interconnections in 6 electric systems, and is a member of the =Alliance RTO. FirstEnergy has a market capitalization of $8.1 billion, a P/=E ratio of 12.99, and its shares currently are priced at $35.72.=20GPU Inc. is an international provider of energy-related infrastructure and =services. Domestically, its three electric utility subsidiaries-doing busin=ess as GPU Energy-serve two million customers in Pennsylvania and New Jerse=y. Through the GPU International Group, GPU develops, owns and operates tra=nsmission and distribution facilities overseas. GPU has a market capitaliza=tion of $4.8 billion, a P/E ratio of 10.51, and on its last day of trading =(Nov. 6) its shares were priced at $40.39.From its inception, the primary objective of this acquisition was to enable= FirstEnergy to become the premier regional energy and related services pro=vider in the northeastern quadrant of the United States. A key part of this= strategy is the expansion of the combined company's unregulated marketing =opportunities, including the acceleration of a retail business that FirstEn=ergy gains by buying GPU.After Nov. 7, FirstEnergy will begin operating as a registered holding comp=any with seven electric utility operating companies-Ohio Edison, The Illumi=nating Company, Toledo Edison, Metropolitan Edison, Pennsylvania Electric, =Pennsylvania Power, and Jersey Power & Light-which reportedly will comprise= the fourth-largest investor-owned electric system in the United States, ba=sed on amount of customers. As noted the combined company has billed itself= as the premier supplier in a 13-state region. Those 13 states are New York=, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Oh=io, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. However, it is cl=ear that, among these 13 states, the combined company has already establish=ed a particularly strong business in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, whe=re it will maintain a geographic presence of 23 percent, 28 percent and 49 =percent, respectively.=20According to a presentation made by CEO Peter Burg earlier this year, the a=cquisition of GPU Inc. will ""optimize FirstEnergy's generation portfolio,"" =by, among other things, increasing its customer load and the utilization of= its baseload units. Prior to the acquisition, FirstEnergy operated 16 powe=r plants with a total system capacity of nearly 13,000 MW. Out of this tota=l generating capacity, 58 percent (7,471 MW) is produced using coal; 29 per=cent (3,779 MW) comes from nuclear plants; 10 percent (1,273 MW) is fueled =by natural gas or oil; and 3 percent (435 MW) comes from pumped-storage hyd=roelectric facilities. Through the acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy reported=ly will gain 1,155 MW in peaking generation and the opportunity for over 80=0 MW of capacity releases. Company information indicates that FirstEnergy p=roduced nearly 70 million MWh of electricity over the last year.=20As noted, while the partnership between FirstEnergy and GPU is for the most= part quite synergistic and has obtained its necessary regulatory approvals= in a comparatively smooth fashion, the deal has not been completely withou=t controversy. For instance, a Pittsburgh-based consumer group known as Cit=izen Power has expressed concern that the partnership will ultimately prove= harmful for consumers of the combined company. Specifically, the group cla=ims that FirstEnergy customers have already been paying $9 billion in stran=ded costs and could be forced to pay for additional charges associated with= GPU's partial ownership of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant. Despite th=e fact that the merger is now officially completed, Citizen Power reportedl=y has asked a Pennsylvania court to require state energy regulators in that= state to reverse the approval of the merger. One of the group's arguments =is that the Pennsylvania PUC did not require either FirstEnergy or GPU to d=emonstrate how the merger would benefit or otherwise impact the public and =did not seek approval from the groups involved in GPU's restructuring agree=ment with the state. Other groups in Ohio have similar frustrations with th=e PUC in that state and are concerned about any increases in FirstEnergy ra=tes that may occur as a result of payments that GPU is still making toward =Three Mile Island.=20There is some public confusion surrounding GPU's holdings in Three Mile Isl=and, which can be easily clarified. There are two nuclear units at the Thre=e Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant, Units 1 and 2. In late 1999, GPU sold TM=I-1 to AmerGen Energy, the joint venture between PECO Energy and British En=ergy Co., for $100 million, which was about one-sixth of the book value for= the unit. The ownership of the plant known as TMI-2 has remained with GPU.= In 1979, TMI-2 was the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident, in whi=ch nearly half the uranium core melted. The TMI-2 unit is essentially dead =and has not functioned since 1979. However, GPU has continued to keep the p=lant in a state of ""monitored storage,"" and has encountered some expenses r=elated to staff, etc., which continue to monitor the unit. The concern from= some consumers, whether it is valid or not, is that FirstEnergy, which now= owns TMI-2 due to its acquisition of GPU, will be picking up any residual =expenses related to this unit. Specifically, TMI-2 is not scheduled to be d=ecommissioned until 2014 at the earliest, and there may be some cleanup cos=ts associated with the decommissioning that may exceed current estimates.It is important to note that GPU has very little of its own generation asse=ts. The company has followed a revised strategy over the last year that inc=luded the exit of the merchant energy business and a clear focus on the tra=nsmission and distribution sectors of the industry, as well as new non-regu=lated businesses. Another pending acquisition of some remaining GPU assets =involves UtiliCorp's $2.1 billion offer for Avon Energy Partners Holdings s=ubsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity, which reportedly i=s the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom. Th=is deal should move forward, although it was contingent on the completion o=f FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU. FirstEnergy had previously established =that it had no interest in retaining GPU's international assets, which incl=ude small holdings in Great Britain, Australia and South America. In additi=on, the offer makes sense for FirstEnergy, because it provides the company =with available capital to pay down acquisition debt and possibly fund addit=ional acquisitions.=20Moreover, FirstEnergy executives believe any possible negatives in its acqu=isition of GPU are outweighed by the positives. Again, the fundamental bene=fit of the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership is that it should create one of th=e leading-if not the leading-electric providers in a stretch of territory f=rom Ohio to New Jersey. FirstEnergy gains significantly in the deal by acqu=iring GPU's customer base and the ability to optimize its own existing and =growing generation arsenal. Plus, FirstEnergy also gains GPU's remaining ge=neration capacity, which is rather minimal but does include about 1,155 MW =in peaking generation. From a broad perspective, FirstEnergy and GPU have f=ollowed through with a rather smooth merger process, which certainly repres=ents an atypical development against a landscape of terminated consolidated= deals this year.=20UPDATE ON SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE: See the 11/6/01 IssueAlert  =<http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D979>for a full des=cription of Measures F and I that appeared on the ballot in San Francisco a=nd Brisbane, Calif., in yesterday's election. Both measures related to muni=cipalizing the electric system currently owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co=. According to data obtained from the San Francisco Department of Elections= as of early morning on Nov. 7, voter turnout in the area was 25.16 percent=. Measure F, which would create a Municipal Water & Power Agency in San Fra=ncisco only, passed by a very slim margin of 56,008 votes (51.02 percent) t=o 53,760 votes (48.98). The passage of this measure will create a new agenc=y in the city of San Francisco (not a municipal utility district) that will= not include the city of Brisbane. The agency will be governed by an electe=d seven-member board of directors and reportedly will replace the current j=urisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission.=20Measure I, which would have created a Municipal Utility District (MUD) in b=oth San Francisco and Brisbane, did not pass. However, it was defeated by a= very slim margin of 53,865 votes (50.63 percent) to 52,524 votes (49.37 pe=rcent).=20It is not presently clear whether or not all of the absentee votes have bee=n calculated in this election, and thus there is a good chance that the abo=ve tally may change in the next few days and could possibly alter the outco=me of this election.=20While Pacific Gas & Electric Co. put a positive spin on the election result=s in a press release that is circulating today, the fact of the matter is t=hat this was a very close election. While the city of Brisbane shot down th=e idea of a MUD, San Francisco is proceeding with a Municipal Water & Power= Agency, which at some point may also attempt to seize the transmission and= distribution assets of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Without question, the pu=blic power debate in this area is far from over and in many ways has receiv=ed a boost from this election.

FirstEnergy and GPU Close Merger

y. Through the GPU International Group, GPU develops, owns and operates tra=

nsmission and distribution facilities overseas. GPU has a market capitaliza=

tion of $4.8 billion, a P/E ratio of 10.51, and on its last day of trading =

(Nov. 6) its shares were priced at $40.39.



From its inception, the primary objective of this acquisition was to enable=

 FirstEnergy to become the premier regional energy and related services pro=

vider in the northeastern quadrant of the United States. A key part of this=

 strategy is the expansion of the combined company's unregulated marketing =

opportunities, including the acceleration of a retail business that FirstEn=

ergy gains by buying GPU.



After Nov. 7, FirstEnergy will begin operating as a registered holding comp=

any with seven electric utility operating companies-Ohio Edison, The Illumi=

nating Company, Toledo Edison, Metropolitan Edison, Pennsylvania Electric, =

Pennsylvania Power, and Jersey Power & Light-which reportedly will comprise=

 the fourth-largest investor-owned electric system in the United States, ba=

sed on amount of customers. As noted the combined company has billed itself=

 as the premier supplier in a 13-state region. Those 13 states are New York=

, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Oh=

io, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin. However, it is cl=

ear that, among these 13 states, the combined company has already establish=

ed a particularly strong business in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Ohio, whe=

re it will maintain a geographic presence of 23 percent, 28 percent and 49 =

percent, respectively.=20



According to a presentation made by CEO Peter Burg earlier this year, the a=

cquisition of GPU Inc. will ""optimize FirstEnergy's generation portfolio,"" =

by, among other things, increasing its customer load and the utilization of=

 its baseload units. Prior to the acquisition, FirstEnergy operated 16 powe=

r plants with a total system capacity of nearly 13,000 MW. Out of this tota=

l generating capacity, 58 percent (7,471 MW) is produced using coal; 29 per=

cent (3,779 MW) comes from nuclear plants; 10 percent (1,273 MW) is fueled =

by natural gas or oil; and 3 percent (435 MW) comes from pumped-storage hyd=

roelectric facilities. Through the acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy reported=

ly will gain 1,155 MW in peaking generation and the opportunity for over 80=

0 MW of capacity releases. Company information indicates that FirstEnergy p=

roduced nearly 70 million MWh of electricity over the last year.=20



As noted, while the partnership between FirstEnergy and GPU is for the most=

 part quite synergistic and has obtained its necessary regulatory approvals=

 in a comparatively smooth fashion, the deal has not been completely withou=

t controversy. For instance, a Pittsburgh-based consumer group known as Cit=

izen Power has expressed concern that the partnership will ultimately prove=

 harmful for consumers of the combined company. Specifically, the group cla=

ims that FirstEnergy customers have already been paying $9 billion in stran=

ded costs and could be forced to pay for additional charges associated with=

 GPU's partial ownership of the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant. Despite th=

e fact that the merger is now officially completed, Citizen Power reportedl=

y has asked a Pennsylvania court to require state energy regulators in that=

 state to reverse the approval of the merger. One of the group's arguments =

is that the Pennsylvania PUC did not require either FirstEnergy or GPU to d=

emonstrate how the merger would benefit or otherwise impact the public and =

did not seek approval from the groups involved in GPU's restructuring agree=

ment with the state. Other groups in Ohio have similar frustrations with th=

e PUC in that state and are concerned about any increases in FirstEnergy ra=

tes that may occur as a result of payments that GPU is still making toward =

Three Mile Island.=20



There is some public confusion surrounding GPU's holdings in Three Mile Isl=

and, which can be easily clarified. There are two nuclear units at the Thre=

e Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant, Units 1 and 2. In late 1999, GPU sold TM=

I-1 to AmerGen Energy, the joint venture between PECO Energy and British En=

ergy Co., for $100 million, which was about one-sixth of the book value for=

 the unit. The ownership of the plant known as TMI-2 has remained with GPU.=

 In 1979, TMI-2 was the site of the nation's worst nuclear accident, in whi=

ch nearly half the uranium core melted. The TMI-2 unit is essentially dead =

and has not functioned since 1979. However, GPU has continued to keep the p=

lant in a state of ""monitored storage,"" and has encountered some expenses r=

elated to staff, etc., which continue to monitor the unit. The concern from=

 some consumers, whether it is valid or not, is that FirstEnergy, which now=

 owns TMI-2 due to its acquisition of GPU, will be picking up any residual =

expenses related to this unit. Specifically, TMI-2 is not scheduled to be d=

ecommissioned until 2014 at the earliest, and there may be some cleanup cos=

ts associated with the decommissioning that may exceed current estimates.



It is important to note that GPU has very little of its own generation asse=

ts. The company has followed a revised strategy over the last year that inc=

luded the exit of the merchant energy business and a clear focus on the tra=

nsmission and distribution sectors of the industry, as well as new non-regu=

lated businesses. Another pending acquisition of some remaining GPU assets =

involves UtiliCorp's $2.1 billion offer for Avon Energy Partners Holdings s=

ubsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity, which reportedly i=

s the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom. Th=

is deal should move forward, although it was contingent on the completion o=

f FirstEnergy's acquisition of GPU. FirstEnergy had previously established =

that it had no interest in retaining GPU's international assets, which incl=

ude small holdings in Great Britain, Australia and South America. In additi=

on, the offer makes sense for FirstEnergy, because it provides the company =

with available capital to pay down acquisition debt and possibly fund addit=

ional acquisitions.=20



Moreover, FirstEnergy executives believe any possible negatives in its acqu=

isition of GPU are outweighed by the positives. Again, the fundamental bene=

fit of the FirstEnergy / GPU partnership is that it should create one of th=

e leading-if not the leading-electric providers in a stretch of territory f=

rom Ohio to New Jersey. FirstEnergy gains significantly in the deal by acqu=

iring GPU's customer base and the ability to optimize its own existing and =

growing generation arsenal. Plus, FirstEnergy also gains GPU's remaining ge=

neration capacity, which is rather minimal but does include about 1,155 MW =

in peaking generation. From a broad perspective, FirstEnergy and GPU have f=

ollowed through with a rather smooth merger process, which certainly repres=

ents an atypical development against a landscape of terminated consolidated=

 deals this year.=20



UPDATE ON SAN FRANCISCO MUNICIPALIZATION VOTE: See the 11/6/01 IssueAlert  =

<http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D979>for a full des=

cription of Measures F and I that appeared on the ballot in San Francisco a=

nd Brisbane, Calif., in yesterday's election. Both measures related to muni=

cipalizing the electric system currently owned by Pacific Gas & Electric Co=

. According to data obtained from the San Francisco Department of Elections=

 as of early morning on Nov. 7, voter turnout in the area was 25.16 percent=

. Measure F, which would create a Municipal Water & Power Agency in San Fra=

ncisco only, passed by a very slim margin of 56,008 votes (51.02 percent) t=

o 53,760 votes (48.98). The passage of this measure will create a new agenc=

y in the city of San Francisco (not a municipal utility district) that will=

 not include the city of Brisbane. The agency will be governed by an electe=

d seven-member board of directors and reportedly will replace the current j=

urisdictional oversight by the California Public Utilities Commission.=20



Measure I, which would have created a Municipal Utility District (MUD) in b=

oth San Francisco and Brisbane, did not pass. However, it was defeated by a=

 very slim margin of 53,865 votes (50.63 percent) to 52,524 votes (49.37 pe=

rcent).=20



It is not presently clear whether or not all of the absentee votes have bee=

n calculated in this election, and thus there is a good chance that the abo=

ve tally may change in the next few days and could possibly alter the outco=

me of this election.=20



While Pacific Gas & Electric Co. put a positive spin on the election result=

s in a press release that is circulating today, the fact of the matter is t=

hat this was a very close election. While the city of Brisbane shot down th=

e idea of a MUD, San Francisco is proceeding with a Municipal Water & Power=

 Agency, which at some point may also attempt to seize the transmission and=

 distribution assets of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Without question, the pu=

blic power debate in this area is far from over and in many ways has receiv=

ed a boost from this election. I will continue to follow the story and prov=

ide further updates that occur from regional analysis.=20

Subject:  West U Soccer's New Skill Development Program



Dear Coaches,

In an effort to continue the development  of the West U Soccer program to
become one of the finest in the city, we have  introduced some innovative
ways to provide the players with greater development  while having fun.

This year we have already introduced once  a week training for all players
who participate in the West U Soccer in house  programs.  From the reaction
I have  received to date this has been very successful.  We plan to
continue to make improvement  in this program to make it the finest in the
city.

In pursuit of this goal, West U Soccer is  sponsoring in conjunction with
Nebo Pro Soccer Academy a skill development  program for our players from
U-6 through U-19.

The goals of this program:

?      To provide players in  their development years the ability to
develop the skills necessary to enjoy the  game.

?      Have fun while  learning

?      Play fun games and  play against other competition.

?      Coach mentoring by  association with pro trainers

Last week was a trial run of the clinic  and I have a child who is a U-6
player.   He had a great time and learned a lot about soccer and wants to
go next  week because he had so much fun.

Nebo has done a great job of developing a  curriculum for all types of
player from the serious to the recreational.  He has assembled a staff of
trainers who  are well recognized.

If you have players who may be interested  in the training, I strongly
recommend that you hand out the attached sign-up  sheet at your next
practice.

Please tell the player who are interested  to bring the form on Sunday
September 23 at 5:00 to West U Elementary Field for  sign-up.

Thank you for your consideration on this matter .

      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference
      exist?
 
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because

Art. 3? As opera??es realizadas pela contraparte transferidora do
risco nos termos desta circular devem ser consideradas no c?mputo do
Patrim?nio L?quido Exigido (PLE), de que trata a Resolu??o 2.099, de 17 de
agosto de 1994, e altera??es posteriores, em fun??o do grau de transfer?ncia
do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente.
? 1? Para efeito do disposto neste artigo, considera-se efetiva a
transfer?ncia do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente, com a poss?vel
redu??o do fator de pondera??o a ele aplic?vel, quando:
I - o contrato estabelecer como eventos de cr?dito, no m?nimo, a ocorr?ncia
individual ou conjunta das situa??es previstas no art. 2?, inciso II;
II - o ativo subjacente for legalmente pass?vel de transfer?ncia, nos casos
em que o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito assim o preveja na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito;
III - a contraparte transferidora do risco n?o retiver risco de cr?dito sob
qualquer forma;
IV - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite o cancelamento unilateral
do contrato pela contraparte receptora do risco de cr?dito, exceto na
hip?tese do n?o pagamento pela contraparte transferidora da remunera??o
estabelecida no art. 1?, incisos I e II;
V - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite, ? contraparte receptora do
risco de cr?dito, o n?o cumprimento da obriga??o de efetuar prontamente o
pagamento do montante devido ? contraparte transferidora na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito.
? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante
de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido
com base na seguinte f?rmula:
FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:
FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo
subjacente;
PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);
PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);
FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo
subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o
art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e
altera??es posteriores;
F = ""zero"" nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma
moeda que o ativo subjacente;
F = 0,50 (cinq?enta cent?simos) nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser
contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.
? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante
de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de
Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo
IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.
? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou
percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,
total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de
PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.
Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do
ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.
Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco
garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em
esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco
decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele
aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele
aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es
financeiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectos
relativos ?s opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito:

VI - montante e caracter?sticas das opera??es de cr?ditos
transferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradores
previstos no contrato;
VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).
Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com
base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.
Art. 7? As institui??es devem manter, ? disposi??o do Banco Central
do Brasil, adequadamente documentadas, sua pol?tica e procedimentos para
realiza??o de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, bem como os limites de
exposi??o estabelecidos, independentemente da condi??o de receptora ou
transferidora do risco.
Art. 8? Fica condicionada ? autoriza??o do Banco Central do Brasil a
celebra??o de contrato de derivativo de cr?dito cujo montante seja igual ou
superior a 10% (dez por cento) valor do Patrim?nio de Refer?ncia (PR) da
institui??o que atuar como contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 9? A institui??o deve informar ao Departamento de Cadastro e

Patrim?nio L?quido Exigido (PLE), de que trata a Resolu??o 2.099, de 17 de
agosto de 1994, e altera??es posteriores, em fun??o do grau de transfer?ncia
do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente.
? 1? Para efeito do disposto neste artigo, considera-se efetiva a
transfer?ncia do risco de cr?dito do ativo subjacente, com a poss?vel
redu??o do fator de pondera??o a ele aplic?vel, quando:
I - o contrato estabelecer como eventos de cr?dito, no m?nimo, a ocorr?ncia
individual ou conjunta das situa??es previstas no art. 2?, inciso II;
II - o ativo subjacente for legalmente pass?vel de transfer?ncia, nos casos
em que o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito assim o preveja na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito;
III - a contraparte transferidora do risco n?o retiver risco de cr?dito sob
qualquer forma;
IV - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite o cancelamento unilateral
do contrato pela contraparte receptora do risco de cr?dito, exceto na
hip?tese do n?o pagamento pela contraparte transferidora da remunera??o
estabelecida no art. 1?, incisos I e II;
V - n?o houver cl?usula que possibilite, ? contraparte receptora do
risco de cr?dito, o n?o cumprimento da obriga??o de efetuar prontamente o
pagamento do montante devido ? contraparte transferidora na ocorr?ncia do
evento de cr?dito.
? 2? O fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, a ser aplicado ao montante
de prote??o do ativo subjacente para fins de apura??o do PLE deve ser obtido
com base na seguinte f?rmula:
FP = (1 - F) x (PRP x 50)/PRA + [1- (PRP/PRA)] x FPA + F x FPA, onde:
FP = fator de pondera??o aplic?vel ao montante de prote??o do ativo
subjacente;
PRA = prazo remanescente do ativo subjacente (em dias ?teis);
PRP = prazo remanescente do derivativo de cr?dito (em dias ?teis);
FPA = Fator de pondera??o, em valor percentual, relativo ao ativo
subjacente, conforme a Tabela de Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o
art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e
altera??es posteriores;
F = ""zero"" nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser contratado na mesma
moeda que o ativo subjacente;
F = 0,50 (cinq?enta cent?simos) nas hip?teses do derivativo de cr?dito ser
contratado em outra moeda que n?o a do ativo subjacente.
? 3? A exposi??o ao risco do ativo subjacente que exceder o montante
de prote??o deve ser ponderada pelo seu fator original conforme a Tabela de
Classifica??o dos Ativos de que trata o art. 2?, ? 1?, do Regulamento Anexo
IV ? Resolu??o 2.099, de 1994, e altera??es posteriores.
? 4? Na hip?tese em que estipulada cl?usula relativa a valores ou
percentuais m?nimos de perda do ativo subjacente para que a recomposi??o,
total ou parcial, seja efetuada, deve ser comprovada parcela adicional de
PLE equivalente ao valor ou percentual m?nimo estipulado.
Art. 4? A contraparte receptora do risco fica exposta ao risco de cr?dito do
ativo subjacente na propor??o do risco assumido.
Par?grafo ?nico. Na hip?tese de a contraparte receptora do risco
garantir o contrato de derivativo de cr?dito com a utiliza??o de recursos em
esp?cie ou de t?tulos de emiss?o de terceiros, a exposi??o ao risco
decorrente deve ser ponderada pelo maior fator de pondera??o entre aquele
aplic?vel ao ativo subjacente ao contrato de derivativo de cr?dito e aquele
aplic?vel ? contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 5? ? obrigat?ria a divulga??o, em notas explicativas ?s demonstra??es
financeiras, de informa??es contendo, pelo menos, os seguintes aspectos
relativos ?s opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito:
I - pol?tica, objetivos e estrat?gias da institui??o;
II - processo de gerenciamento de riscos;
III - volumes de risco de cr?dito transferidos (valor cont?bil e de
mercado), total e no per?odo;
IV - receitas e/ou despesas no per?odo;
V - efeito (aumento/redu??o) no c?lculo do PLE;
VI - montante e caracter?sticas das opera??es de cr?ditos
transferidas ou recebidas no per?odo em decorr?ncia dos fatos geradores
previstos no contrato;
VII - segrega??o por tipo (swap de cr?dito e swap de taxa de retorno total).
Art. 6? O Banco Central do Brasil poder? determinar o aumento do PLE, com
base em caracter?sticas intr?nsecas ao contrato.
Art. 7? As institui??es devem manter, ? disposi??o do Banco Central
do Brasil, adequadamente documentadas, sua pol?tica e procedimentos para
realiza??o de opera??es de derivativos de cr?dito, bem como os limites de
exposi??o estabelecidos, independentemente da condi??o de receptora ou
transferidora do risco.
Art. 8? Fica condicionada ? autoriza??o do Banco Central do Brasil a
celebra??o de contrato de derivativo de cr?dito cujo montante seja igual ou
superior a 10% (dez por cento) valor do Patrim?nio de Refer?ncia (PR) da
institui??o que atuar como contraparte transferidora do risco.
Art. 9? A institui??o deve informar ao Departamento de Cadastro e
Informa??es do Sistema financeiro (Decad) o nome do diretor respons?vel pela

David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha=t the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and C=onservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. ""=There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be =renegotiated,"" said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include G=ov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission= and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his =work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as =gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed sin=ce January.=20Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ? remember that? For some,= it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill-f=ated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating con=sequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headline=s in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, ev=en though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat, =some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis continu=e to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were taken =to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into a =very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs (=Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & =Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power on =their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are far= from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence cau=sing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be questio=nable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis.=20At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of Califo=rnia, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generato=rs such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and W=illiams (NYSE: WMB) to name a few back in early 2001, a time at which whole=sale power prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primar=y benefits of the contracts was that they reduced the state's reliance on t=he volatile spot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a =whole the contracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 y=ears or more. Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the =state to assume the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the cont=racts at that time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solven=cy of Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue =that the contracts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices =were the highest.=20Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, b=ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good nu=mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, i=ncluding those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state w=ith a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been for=ced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the sta=te bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MW=h. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002.=20As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as th=e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the managemen=t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at =the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme= situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring powe=r prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub=sided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr=acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time.=20Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Po=wer Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be =guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequent=ly, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a positi=on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carr=ot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could =offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants =in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the =costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to p=rovide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the gen=erating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are commi=tted to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate t=hat 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clause=s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st=ate. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new p=lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds= of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the s=ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long=-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current m=arket conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri=ces in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the t=iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased.=20The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s=ome legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that =California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) =that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next de=cade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased =conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maint=ained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the =state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of =the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot =sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according =to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-u=sage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for whi=ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 c=ents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 mi=llion. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r=each its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010.=20Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logis=tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa=rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In add=ition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea=dy own a large amount of generation capacity in California and may not be e=asily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp.=, which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the s=tate of California, responded to the plan as saying that it ""wouldn't be an=ything that Calpine would use."" The company reportedly has finished three n=ew power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing i=ncentive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to re=negotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale= prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been =a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings. However, since t=he onset of the talks, a good number of the generating companies have maint=ained that re-negotiation would not be possible as they had already locked =themselves into deals with natural-gas suppliers.=20Thus, one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco=urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources, a=t least in the near term, which could set the state up for another dangerou=s boom-and-bust cycle down the road. In addition, those companies that alre=ady have long-term contracts with the state (such as Calpine) may not be en=ticed by the financing incentive, and those companies that don't have long-=term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new pl=ants in California. All of this could create a situation in which Californi=a has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in a=nother shortage situation 10 or more years down the line.=20Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt =to take over some of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s physical assets. Instead =of its transmission lines, however, the state now is examining its opportun=ity to buy the hydroelectric generation network (including dams and powerho=uses) owned by the state's largest electric utility. Note that under its re=structuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval, Pacific G=as & Electric Co. would split from its parent, PG&E Corp., and transfer gen=erating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companie=s, which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory= Commission (FERC). State regulators do not like this plan, and thus are se=eking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets o=f Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Putting the hydroelectric assets under the Sta=te Power Authority would keep the assets under state control.=20Moreover, even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almo=st a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy m=arket, state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental =parts of the state's energy infrastructure. Remember that Gov. Davis spent =much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE= and SDG&E for the purchase of the utilities' transmission networks. Pacifi=c Gas & Electric Co. never was interested in selling its transmission asset=s, which it believed the state's offer grossly undervalued. One of the main= reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern =by state legislators who argued that the state was ill equipped to assume o=peration of the complex transmission networks.

[News item from the Los Angeles Times] After months of defending the $43 bi=

llion worth of long-term electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behal=

f of the state, S. David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha=

t the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and C=

onservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. ""=

There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be =

renegotiated,"" said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include G=

ov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission=

 and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his =

work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as =

gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed sin=

ce January.=20



Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ? remember that? For some,=

 it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill-f=

ated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating con=

sequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headline=

s in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, ev=

en though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat, =

some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis continu=

e to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were taken =

to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into a =

very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs (=

Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & =

Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power on =

their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are far=

 from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence cau=

sing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be questio=

nable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis.=20



At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of Califo=

rnia, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generato=

rs such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and W=

illiams (NYSE: WMB) to name a few back in early 2001, a time at which whole=

sale power prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primar=

y benefits of the contracts was that they reduced the state's reliance on t=

he volatile spot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a =

whole the contracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 y=

ears or more. Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the =

state to assume the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the cont=

racts at that time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solven=

cy of Pacific Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue =

that the contracts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices =

were the highest.=20



Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, b=

ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good nu=

mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, i=

ncluding those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state w=

ith a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been for=

ced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the sta=

te bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MW=

h. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002.=20



As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as th=

e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the managemen=

t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at =

the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme=

 situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring powe=

r prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub=

sided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr=

acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time.=20



Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Po=

wer Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be =

guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequent=

ly, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a positi=

on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carr=

ot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could =

offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants =

in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the =

costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to p=

rovide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the gen=

erating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are commi=

tted to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate t=

hat 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clause=

s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st=

ate. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new p=

lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds=

 of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the s=

ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long=

-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current m=

arket conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri=

ces in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the t=

iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased.=20



The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s=

ome legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that =

California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) =

that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next de=

cade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased =

conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maint=

ained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the =

state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of =

the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot =

sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according =

to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-u=

sage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for whi=

ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 c=

ents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 mi=

llion. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r=

each its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010.=20



Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logis=

tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa=

rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In add=

ition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea=

dy own a large amount of generation capacity in California and may not be e=

asily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp.=

, which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the s=

tate of California, responded to the plan as saying that it ""wouldn't be an=

ything that Calpine would use."" The company reportedly has finished three n=

ew power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing i=

ncentive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to re=

negotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale=

 prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been =

a fixture of state legislative and regulatory proceedings. However, since t=

he onset of the talks, a good number of the generating companies have maint=

ained that re-negotiation would not be possible as they had already locked =

themselves into deals with natural-gas suppliers.=20



Thus, one concern is that the apparent energy glut in California will disco=

urage further development of new generation and renewable energy sources, a=

t least in the near term, which could set the state up for another dangerou=

s boom-and-bust cycle down the road. In addition, those companies that alre=

ady have long-term contracts with the state (such as Calpine) may not be en=

ticed by the financing incentive, and those companies that don't have long-=

term contracts with the state will have no incentive at all to build new pl=

ants in California. All of this could create a situation in which Californi=

a has too much power over the next few years and then will find itself in a=

nother shortage situation 10 or more years down the line.=20



Freeman is apparently also pushing the state to once again make an attempt =

to take over some of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s physical assets. Instead =

of its transmission lines, however, the state now is examining its opportun=

ity to buy the hydroelectric generation network (including dams and powerho=

uses) owned by the state's largest electric utility. Note that under its re=

structuring plan that has been submitted for regulatory approval, Pacific G=

as & Electric Co. would split from its parent, PG&E Corp., and transfer gen=

erating and electric and gas transmission assets to form three new companie=

s, which would fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory=

 Commission (FERC). State regulators do not like this plan, and thus are se=

eking a way to retain control over the generating and transmission assets o=

f Pacific Gas & Electric Co. Putting the hydroelectric assets under the Sta=

te Power Authority would keep the assets under state control.=20



Moreover, even though California is rethinking certain choices it made almo=

st a year ago that directly entrenched the state government in the energy m=

arket, state officials still seem to want to gain control over fundamental =

parts of the state's energy infrastructure. Remember that Gov. Davis spent =

much of the last year attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate deals with SCE=

 and SDG&E for the purchase of the utilities' transmission networks. Pacifi=

c Gas & Electric Co. never was interested in selling its transmission asset=

s, which it believed the state's offer grossly undervalued. One of the main=

 reasons that these attempts by the governor were unsuccessful was concern =

by state legislators who argued that the state was ill equipped to assume o=

peration of the complex transmission networks. Nevertheless, in addition to=

 renegotiating the long-term contracts, the state is still pursuing at leas=

t the hydroelectric generation assets of Pacific Gas & Electric.=20

California Develops Plan=20

to Renegotiate Long-Term=20

Power Contracts as State=20

Faces Energy Surplus=20







By Will McNamara

Director, Electric Industry Analysis











[News item from the Los Angeles Times] After months of defending the $43 bi=

llion worth of long-term electricity contracts he helped negotiate on behal=

f of the state, S. David Freeman suggested for the first time this week tha=

t the contracts be renegotiated, perhaps through the California Power and C=

onservation Financing Authority, a new public power agency he now chairs. ""=

There seems to be pretty general agreement that these contracts need to be =

renegotiated,"" said Freeman, noting that critics of the contracts include G=

ov. Gray Davis, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission=

 and the leader of the State Senate. Freeman said he is still proud of his =

work negotiating the contracts with companies Davis labeled at the time as =

gougers and pirates, but California's energy picture has vastly changed sin=

ce January.=20



Analysis: Oh, yeah, the California energy crisis ... remember that? For som=

e, it may seem like ancient history that California suffered through an ill=

-fated experiment with electric deregulation that led to some devastating c=

onsequences, especially considering the Enron saga that now occupies headli=

nes in the energy industry. Nevertheless, it should not be forgotten that, =

even though rolling blackouts in the state are no longer an imminent threat=

, some fundamental problems that defined the California energy crisis conti=

nue to plague the state. As one of the main resolution steps that were take=

n to repair the dysfunctional market, the state of California stepped into =

a very involved role as power purchaser on behalf of the state's three IOUs=

 (Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas =

& Electric Co.), which due to credit problems were unable to secure power o=

n their own. In an ironic twist indicating that California's problems are f=

ar from over, the stabilization of the state's markets are now in essence c=

ausing a new set of challenges and casting light on what appear to be quest=

ionable choices made by the state at the height of the crisis.=20



At issue presently are some 54 long-term contracts that the state of Califo=

rnia, through its Department of Water Resources, signed with power generato=

rs such as Calpine (NYSE: CPN), Duke (NYSE: DUK), Mirant (NYSE: MIR), and W=

illiams (NYSE: WMB) back in early 2001, at a time at which wholesale power =

prices were still running at very high levels. One of the primary benefits =

of the contracts was that it reduced the state's reliance on the volatile s=

pot market, where prices had soared as high as $500/MWh. As a whole the con=

tracts are worth about $43 billion and have a lifespan of 10 years or more.=

 Some might argue that Gov. Davis, who led the effort for the state to assu=

me the role of power purchaser, felt pressure to sign the contracts at that=

 time, due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial solvency of Pacific=

 Gas & Electric and SCE in particular. However, critics argue that the cont=

racts locked the state into wholesale power costs when prices were the high=

est.=20



Much of the details of the contracts signed by the state are proprietary, b=

ut there are some interesting details that can be gleaned. First, a good nu=

mber of the contracts lock the state in to buying power at various times, i=

ncluding those of low demand (such as the morning). This leaves the state w=

ith a surplus of power that it does not need, which it in turn has been for=

ced to sell at a loss. We also know that, as a general observation, the sta=

te bought power under the long-term contracts at an average price of $75/MW=

h. That same power reportedly will sell for only $16/MWh in 2002.=20



As noted, Freeman, who previously managed the municipal utility known as th=

e Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, recently assumed the managemen=

t post of the new California Power and Conservation Financing Authority at =

the request of Gov. Davis. The agency was charged with quelling the extreme=

 situation that California faced over the last year, including soaring powe=

r prices and blackouts. Looking beyond the immediate problems that have sub=

sided, Freeman's new plan calls for a way to renegotiate the existing contr=

acts and increase generation supply in the state at the same time.=20



Let me try to put Freeman's plan into a nutshell. As a state agency, the Po=

wer Authority could sell up to $4 billion in revenue bonds, which would be =

guaranteed by energy sales, to lease, build or buy power plants. Consequent=

ly, the state, which can borrow money at below-market rates, is in a positi=

on to build new plants more cheaply than private companies could. As a carr=

ot to entice the renegotiation of the long-term contracts, the state could =

offer generating companies a financial incentive to build new power plants =

in the state. In other words, the state would carry the investment for the =

costs of the new plants, alleviating pressure on the private companies to p=

rovide a 20-percent return to their shareholders. Note that most of the gen=

erating companies involved in long-term contracts with California are commi=

tted to building new power plants anyway. Some reports I've seen indicate t=

hat 70 percent of the 54 contracts that the state has signed include clause=

s that require the generating companies to build new power plants in the st=

ate. However, under normal circumstances, the expense of building the new p=

lants would be financed by the generating companies and could cost hundreds=

 of millions of dollars. Thus, in return for the financial incentive, the s=

ame generating companies would agree to renegotiate the terms of their long=

-term contracts with the state of California, presumably based on current m=

arket conditions. Note that the renegotiation could include cutting the pri=

ces in the contracts, or providing the state with more flexibility on the t=

iming and quantity of electricity that must be purchased.=20



The word from California is that most state officials think this plan has s=

ome legs. Nevertheless, word of the plan comes on the heels of claims that =

California is presently suffering from an energy glut (unused electricity) =

that may end up costing ratepayers as much as $3.9 billion over the next de=

cade. The reason for the surplus power is that Californians have increased =

conservation efforts, which brought demand down, a condition that was maint=

ained by comparatively moderate weather trends. The end result is that the =

state apparently bought far more power than it needed to meet the needs of =

the customers served by the three IOUs, and the state unfortunately cannot =

sell the excess power elsewhere and gain a profit. For instance, according =

to a report by the Department of Water Resources, in one three-month, low-u=

sage period expected in the spring of 2002, 57 percent of the power for whi=

ch the state has contracted will have to be sold at a loss of close to 80 c=

ents on the dollar, ultimately costing utility customers as much as $193 mi=

llion. The same report indicates that the power surplus in the state will r=

each its peak in 2004 and then gradually decline through 2010.=20



Consequently, despite the financial advantages of Freeman's plan, the logis=

tics of getting new power plants approved in the state in light of the appa=

rent energy glut may be an impediment to the renegotiation strategy. In add=

ition, some of the companies involved in the contracts with the state alrea=

dy own a large amount of generation capacity in the state and may not be ea=

sily convinced to build new plants right away. For instance, Calpine Corp.,=

 which is one of the companies that has signed a long-term deal with the st=

ate of California, responded to the plan as saying that it ""wouldn't be any=

thing that Calpine would use."" The company reportedly has finished three ne=

w power plants since June 2001 and would not be enticed by the financing in=

centive that the state is orchestrating. Further, the state's desire to ren=

egotiate terms of the contracts is not a new concept. Ever since wholesale =

prices began to drop earlier this year, the renegotiation debate has been a=

e onset of the talks, a good number of the generating companies have mainta=

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking.  Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time.  The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized.  The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.  'Minimum Approach' in Performance Reporting EffortFASB's new rulemaking on performance reporting represents an effort toimprove and make more useful information displayed on all the basicfinancial statements, both interim and annual. In such a ""display andpresentation"" project, the board would not address recognition andmeasurement questions, according to a staff summary.  FASB's staffrecommended that the board ""stick close"" to what is known as the minimumapproach in the performance reporting project, said Ronald Bossio, a seniorstaff project manager. Pursuing that approach was the avenue favored by mostof the board's constituents who expressed support for starting thestandard-setting effort. The minimum approach is described by FASB's staff as one that would have theboard ""explore whether certain line items, subtotals, and totals should bedefined in standards and required to be displayed in financial statements,including interim statements.  ""Line items and amounts that would beconsidered include those related to metrics commonly used by investors andcreditors in assessing financial performance,"" the staff continued in asummary distributed at the board's Oct. 24 meeting. Favored less by constituents and not advocated so far by any board member inpreliminary discussions is a broader approach. Under that, FASB woulddescribe how key financial metrics--usually ratios or some otherindicator--should be calculated if they are presented in financialstatements. However, the methods of figuring such metrics would not berequired to be shown in the financial statements, according to the staff'ssummary of the broader path. Gary Schieneman, a veteran security analyst who joined FASB in July, said hesupports taking on the project on performance reporting. He added, however,""I think it will be difficult to stick closely to the minimum approach.""Michael Crooch, a colleague on the board, said he, too, supports therulemaking effort, but voiced a concern that the effort ""may be a projectthat has no bounds. This is one we have to watch with regard to scope.""  TheInternational Accounting Standards Board has begun its own standard-settingon performance reporting. That task is being carried out jointly with theUnited Kingdom's Accounting Standards Board in an effort, in part, towardhelping ensure convergence of financial reporting rules around the world.FASB plans to monitor the IASB-ASB joint project. Defining SimplificationWulff, a former high-ranking financial executive at Union Carbide who joinedFASB with Schieneman, first raised the issue of perhaps taking on otherprojects--revenue recognition and simplification--when he was asked to voicea view on embarking on the performance reporting project.  what""simplification"" is came to a head in FASB's debate when Wulff, weighing theintangible assets project, questioned moving ahead on that effort beforeunderstanding how many staff resources would be used in writing standards ondisclosures about intangibles. Some in the community of financial statement preparers--generally U.S.corporations and their trade groups--oppose FASB's taking on the performancereporting and intangibles projects. Instead, they suggest the accountingboard should begin rulemaking on liability and revenue recognition and whatthe Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) labels ""FASBCodification/Simplification.""  FASB board members and IASB's liaison to theU.S. board, James Leisenring, said they know what codification means. Thename signifies a collection of FASB's authoritative literature and GAAP ingeneral that should be collected in ""one comprehensive format,"" as IMA'sFinancial Reporting Committee wrote in a Sept. 19 letter to the accountingboard. However, several board members and Leisenring, FASB's former vice chairman,regarded arguments for simplification warily, as shown by their commentsOct. 24.  ""I know what codification is,"" said Leisenring. ""I don't know whatsimplification is."" He and FASB members Neel Foster and Katherine Schippersuggested they know what simplification could mean, but did not elaborate,instead making veiled references to moves such as requiring full fairvalue-based recognition of financial instruments in the income statement,widely opposed by banks and corporations.Simplification a Complicated Effort""I also know that isn't what they want,"" Leisenring said of advocates of asimplification project. He suggested that, if such a project is anythinglike IASB's current effort to improve existing international accountingstandards, simplification would prove not so simple--and would consumehundreds of hours of staff time ""if it's a serious endeavor.""  Fosterlabeled arguments that FASB should begin a simplification effort ""an attemptto tie this organization up for the next 20 years."" Schipper, who alone objected to Jenkins's compromise on the intangiblesproject, said the board should begin the rulemaking on disclosures aboutintangibles ""immediately"" and proceed ""full speed ahead."" Schipper cited the lack of comparability in current reporting on purchasedintangible assets, which are accounted for under FASB's new rules onbusiness combinations, and on intangibles that are internally generated. Thelatter and their values often are not reflected at all in financialstatements, although they are said to be key drivers in the so-called ""neweconomy."" In-process research and development, which figured prominently in mergersand acquisitions in the high technology sector, ""needs a very strong look,""she added.  Schipper, a former accounting professor at the University ofChicago and Duke University, said of accounting for intangibles: ""This issuehas been studied up and down, left and right, ... from floor to ceiling.""You may think [the academic] research is stupid and misguided. I don't,""she said in urging a quick start on standard-setting.Other Action by FASBIn other action at its Oct. 24 meeting, the board tentatively decided to: 	*	reactivate its dormant project on costs associated withactivities stemming from disposal of a factory or other hard asset used in adiscontinued business operation and reconsider all of the guidance in IssueNo. 94-3 of FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force, ""Liability Recognition forCertain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity,""including one-time employee termination benefits and other restructuringcosts; 	*	issue draft rules in mid-November to rescind FASB StatementNo. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and to makemiscellaneous technical corrections, including non-substantive changes toFASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and amendments related to FASBStatements No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and OtherIntangible Assets; and 	*	consider at an upcoming meeting plans to revive--and mostlikely head in a different rulemaking direction than previously pursued--theboard's 20-year-old project on consolidations policy, or defining when anaffiliate of a company should be deemed a subsidiary and have its activitiesincluded in the financial statements of the parent.In previous incarnations of FASB, an accounting model based on control of anentity did not garner enough support to advance to a final accountingstandard and was criticized strongly by FEI and others. The control-basedmodel departed from the traditional majority equity ownership model, whichseveral FASB members suggest is not followed in current practice despite itsstanding as accounting gospel.Railtrack, Swissair First Test of Europe's Default Swap MarketBloomberg - October 2001By Tom KohnEurope's $250 billion market for credit default swaps, a form of insuranceagainst companies missing their debt payments, is getting its first test asRailtrack Plc and Swissair Group wrestle with insolvency. Credit default swaps let banks and other investors juggle the risk that abond or loan won't be paid back. The buyer of such protection pays an annualpremium, and the seller pays if there's a so-called credit event, such as acompany going bankrupt. ``Railtrack is the bigger of the two tests to the overall market,'' saidDale Lattanzio, head of structured credit trading at Merrill Lynch & Co.``While the government said the bonds will be OK, under the terms of thecontract it triggered a credit event, and the credit derivatives market istreating it'' as such. Britain's government seized control of Railtrack on Sunday to stop the ownerof the U.K.'s rail network going bankrupt. It would have debts of 700million pounds ($1 billion) by December and 1.7 billion pounds by March,government lawyer David Richards told the High Court. Railtrack owesbondholders more than $2.2 billion. Swissair is seeking bankruptcy protection after running out of money Oct. 1.Europe's seventh-biggest airline owes bondholders $2.6 billion. Thecompany's market value is currently $48 million, after its shares fell 97percent this year. Settling Claims Default swaps traded for both companies, and were triggered by theannouncements. ``We're going through the process of settling claims,'' said Lattanzio.``There's a broad agreement in the London-based credit derivatives market,and it's been fairly orderly with no market disruptions.'' Sellers of credit protection aren't likely to refuse to pay out on theircontracts, traders said. Still, because the companies' near-bankruptciessparked swap payments it will test the legal contracts on which the banksrely. Credit derivative agreements depend on legal documents developed by theInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents about 540securities firms. Banks use ISDA contracts for credit default swaps toensure their agreements won't collapse if unexpected events occur. ISDA defines a credit event as ``bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligationdefault, obligation acceleration, repudiation or moratorium, andrestructuring.'' ``The likelihood is that the documentation should stand up,'' said RuthAinslie, senior policy director at ISDA in New York. She said that dependsif banks used ISDA agreements and ``whether or not they have been radicallychanged.'' ISDA has received legal opinions on Swiss and U.K. jurisdiction,because ISDA contracts cover a ``very broad range'' of agreements, she said.`Consternation' The U.K. government plans to transfer Railtrack's bonds into a new company,rated at least ``BBB'' by Standard & Poor's and ``Baa2'' by Moody's.Bondholders would get interest and be repaid when the debt matures at``broadly'' the same terms, Transport Secretary Stephen Byers said thisweek. ``Initially there was consternation when Railtrack was put intoreceivership,'' said Ned Swan, a partner and derivatives specialist at lawfirm Simmons & Simmons. Still, ``it's a major company with major assets. Itwas a surprise, but these things will be worked out.'' The Bank of England estimates the credit derivatives market has a face valueof about $1 trillion, with credit default swaps accounting for about halfthe market. London trading accounts for ``just under'' half the market. Upto 2,000 swaps on companies are traded, with 500 to 1,000 trading``actively.'' the bank said in a June report. The central bank cited British Bankers' Association and U.S. governmentfigures as well as its own estimates. The U.S. Office for the Comptroller ofthe Currency reported U.S. commercial banks had credit derivatives with aface value of $351 billion at the end of the second quarter. U.K. securities watchdog the Financial Services Authority monitors the bankstrading credit default swaps, though doesn't regulate credit derivatives. ``We don't regulate it as a product,'' said Karin Loudon, an FSAspokeswoman. ``It's up to the banks to manage their own legal risk.'' UBS AG sued Deutsche Bank AG for $10 million at Britain's high court inMarch for failing to pay on a default swap when Armstrong World IndustriesInc., the U.S.'s biggest vinyl-flooring maker, defaulted on its debt. The dispute centered on Armstrong's name, because the contract referred toits parent company, Armstrong Holdings Inc., according to the court filing.The two banks settled the suit March 15. An FSA spokesman said at the timethat regulators don't typically intervene in such cases because banksusually resolve disputes among themselves. Canada Publishes Final Regulations To Implement Financial Services FrameworkBNA - October 25, 2001OTTAWA--The Canadian government has implemented new framework legislationfor the financial services sector, including domestic and foreign banks,trust companies, insurance companies, credit unions and other financialinstitutions, Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions)James Peterson said Oct. 24. Implementation of Bill C-8, An Act to establish the Financial ConsumerAgency of Canada and to amend certain Acts in relation to financialinstitutions, coincides with the publication of a finalized package ofregulations necessary to give effect to the legislation's provisions,Peterson said in a statement. ""The measures contained in Bill C-8 will help to ensure that the Canadianfinancial services sector continues to be among the safest and mostaccessible in the world,"" he said. ""The legislation will promote efficiencyand growth in the sector, foster international competitiveness and domesticcompetition, empower and protect consumers of financial services, andimprove the regulatory environment."" The legislation also creates the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, whichbegins operations Oct. 24 and will enforce compliance with the legislation'sconsumer provisions and educate consumers on how the legislation benefitsthem, he said. The new agency has been in the public spotlight recently as anecessary element of the federal government's efforts to track down andfreeze assets in Canada of international terrorist organizations. The Department of Finance published the finalized package of 75 regulationsin the Oct. 24, 2001 issue of the Canada Gazette, Part II. The regulationsare particularly important because a key element of the new financialframework is the use of regulations to provide a more flexible regulatoryenvironment for the financial sector, said a regulatory impact analysisstatement published with the finalized regulations. ""This allows the government to make modest policy adjustments to theframework in response to significant changes taking place in the globalenvironment in which financial institutions operate. Many regulations arebeing proposed or modified in order to achieve this policy objective ofcreating a more flexible regulatory regime,"" the impact analysis statementsaid. The current proposals are the first of several packages of regulations thatwill be brought forward to implement the policy intent of the new Act, andwill include regulations essential to operation of the legislation, it said.Of the 75 regulations, 37 relate to the new framework's restructuring of thepermitted investment regime, while 18 are related to the new holding companyregime for financial institutions, six relate to creation of the newFinancial Consumer Agency of Canada, six relate to changes to the foreignbank regime and the remaining eight are aimed at various other policyobjectives, it said. Key areas of the regulations relate to the activities of banks include: 	*	definition of ""aggregate financial exposure"" for banksengaging in certain transactions with related parties that are not federallyregulated financial institutions; 	*	limits on the commercial lending activities of financialinstitutions other than banks; 	*	requirements for financial institutions to inform customerswith a complaint about a product or service on how to contact the FinancialConsumer Agency of Canada; 	*	exemption of certain classes of entities from the status ofbeing an entity associated with a foreign bank and exemption of certainclasses of entities from the definition of foreign bank; 	*	definition of the term ""equity"" when used in dealing withownership rules for banks and demutualized insurance companies; 	*	rules on the investment powers of entities in which afinancial institution holds more than 10 percent of the voting shares or 25percent of the equity, but not control; 	*	definition of ""financial leasing""; 	*	prescription of a range of information-processing activitiespermitted for banks and authorized foreign banks, including payrollprocessing, clearing and management of deposit accounts; 	*	prescribed limits for the amounts of real property andequity investments permitted for financial institutions; 	*	rules governing the ability of an entity to identify itselfas a member of a group in describing its corporate relationship with aforeign bank; 	*	prohibitions that apply to a foreign bank's real propertyactivities outside of its authorized foreign bank branch; 	*	rules governing the content of a prospectus; 	*	expansion of the scope of commercial companies in whichfinancial institutions are permitted to invest, subject to a number ofconstraints and caps; and 	*	provisions permitting regulated securities entities to holdshares of a parent bank holding company to a limit of one percent of thebank holding company's regulatory capital.End Of Cantor Treasurys Quotes On Telerate Causes BotherDow Jones - October 25, 2001TOKYO -- Some Japanese institutional investors were a little peeved Thursdaywhen information provider Telerate stopped offering Treasurys' pricing frommajor inter-dealer broker Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, but the changehasn't hampered trading of U.S. government debt, said Tokyo traders.Telerate, owned by Moneyline, stopped posting Cantor Fitzgerald real-timeU.S. Treasury bond pricing on its screens globally from 5:00 p.m. EDTWednesday. The information and data provider said it would replace theservice with price quotes from rival inter-dealer broker BrokerTec GlobalLLC. But as of 0700 GMT (3:00 a.m. EDT Thursday) the display remained blank.The reason for the change wasn't immediately clear.""Investors have called in to say it's inconvenient that they can't check theCantor page (on Telerate) and have asked about prices,"" said a foreignsecurities house trader in Tokyo. ""They are now logging onto the Cantor'swebsite or having to set up a Cantor page on a Bloomberg terminal.""Apart from a bit of hassle suffered by some investors, however, impact ontrading was limited.Even with comprehensive on-screen price data investors will typically phoneup several brokerages to get bond price quotes before deciding to trade,said a trader at a large Japanese insurance company. Losing access to priceindications wouldn't change that practice, he added.Brokerage and bank Treasurys dealers, and their colleagues in the swapsmarket, were unaffected as apparently none of them rely solely on theTelerate service for U.S. debt security pricing information, traders said.Telerate continues to provide limited non real-time U.S. government bondpricing data from Cantor Fitzgerald and other brokers on a separate display.The Case for Catastrophe BondsThe New York Times - October 25, 2001By Hal R. VarianThe insurance industry faces claims of at least $40 billion tied to theWorld Trade Center attacks, and it remains exposed to significant risk fromfuture incidents. Retail insurance companies are considering exclusions forterrorist damage, leaving property owners unable to buy the coverage theyneed.The problem lies in the reinsurance industry, the wholesale market whereinsurers lay off large risks to pools of investors willing to absorb them.Warren E. Buffett's reinsurance company, General Re, has done well in thelast few years offering property reinsurance because there have not beenmajor hurricanes or earthquakes. But its luck ran out last month: General Rehas said it is liable for over $2 billion of the total industry losses inthe Sept. 11 attacks.Earthquakes and hurricanes, unpleasant as they are, present manageablerisks: insurers know roughly how often they occur in various places, whattheir likely magnitudes are and how much property damage might be expected.Terrorist risk is much harder to quantify, leading to the current paralysisin the reinsurance market. The insurance industry has been lobbying inWashington to make the federal government the insurer of last resort againstterrorism, which means that taxpayers will end up bearing the financial riskof future attacks.Britain adopted a government-backed reinsurance market several years agoand, so far, it has worked reasonably well. But there is another way tosupplement traditional reinsurance markets that has been attractingincreasing attention: catastrophe bonds. These bonds, generally sold tolarge institutions, have typically been tied to natural disasters, likeearthquakes or hurricanes, but they could, in principle, be used to providefinancial backing for terrorism insurance.Here is how they work. A financial intermediary, like a reinsurance companyor an investment bank, issues a bond tied to a particular insurable event,like a Los Angeles earthquake. If there is no earthquake, investors are paida generous interest rate. But if the earthquake occurs and the claims exceedan amount specified in the bond, investors sacrifice their principal andinterest.How generous does the interest rate have to be? That is left up to themarket. If the bond sales offer cheaper reinsurance coverage than dotraditional private placements used in the reinsurance market, these bonds,known as cat bonds, are a preferred method of finance.Cat bonds are a form of ""contingent security,"" a concept first formulated byKenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, winner of the 1972 Nobel ineconomic science. Back in 1952, Professor Arrow came up with the idea of a security that wouldpay a fixed amount of money depending on whether or not some event occurred.He showed that portfolios of such contingent securities could be used toallocate virtually any kind of risk in an efficient manner.The analysis by Professor Arrow was long thought to be of only theoreticalinterest. But it turned out that all sorts of options and other derivativescould be best understood using contingent securities. Now Wall Street rocketscientists draw on this 50-year-old work when creating exotic newderivatives.There are a number of special cases of contingent securities. Consider asecurity tied to my house burning down. This would certainly affect my networth, but would have negligible impact on the owners of the other 70million housing units in the United States.This kind of personal risk can easily be shared among many people, eachpaying only a small amount if the event occurs, and homeowners insurance isto ease this kind of risk sharing.This works fine for small independent risks, but there are other sorts ofevents that impose large costs on many people at the same time, likeearthquakes or hurricanes. Insurance companies are able to deal with suchevents using reinsurance markets, where the risk is transferred to largeinvestors.There are other financial institutions that also allow for risk transfer forthis sort of widespread risk. The orange juice futures market in Chicago isessentially a market in a contingent security tied to whether it freezes inOrlando, Fla.A futures market allows market participants who bear a significant risk(like farmers worried that their crop might be destroyed) to transfer someof that risk to others, who are, of course, paid to absorb it. The futuresmarket allows shifting of risk rather than a simple sharing of risk.Risk sharing and risk shifting are familiar terms, but there is anotherphenomenon worth noting, something I like to call ""risk shafting."" This iswhen some risk - often a particularly large risk - is transferred to a thirdparty who is forced to bear it involuntarily.In many cases, these third parties are taxpayers, who are not even aware oftheir potential liability.Hence the debate that is going on in Washington now: should the insuranceindustry be able to transfer the risk from future terrorist attacks totaxpayers? Or would it be better to use existing reinsurance markets or newfinancial instruments like catastrophe bonds to shift the risk to thosewilling and able to bear it if appropriately compensated?Cat bonds have some attractive features. They can spread risks widely andcan be subdivided indefinitely, allowing each investor to bear only a smallpart of the risk. The money backing up the insurance is paid in advance, sothere is no default risk to the insured.As the market for cat bonds matures, secondary markets may develop,particularly if the bonds become standardized and bundled into portfolios.If so, the market price of cat bonds will reflect the market perceptions ofthe likelihood of the event associated with the bond, just as price changeson the orange juice futures market reflect the likelihood of a freeze inFlorida.The market for cat bonds is still immature, and is only a fraction of thesize of traditional reinsurance. But cat bonds and other sorts of contingentsecurities may well end up being part of the long-run solution to theproblems of the reinsurance industry.**End of ISDA Press Report for October 25, 2001**THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'SBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA ONLY.

FASB Adds Performance Reporting Project, Defers Intangible Assets Disclosure
Decision 
BNA - October 25, 2001

NORWALK, Conn.--The Financial Accounting Standards Board Oct. 24 formally
added a project on performance reporting to its rulemaking agenda, but it
deferred a decision on whether to start a separate standard-setting effort
on disclosures about intangible assets.  The topic of intangibles was the
subject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed its
importance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two other
issues vying for the attention of rulemakers. 

FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that an
effort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that form
statements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standards
on revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitable
candidates for rulemaking.  Major U.S. corporations, through at least one
trade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the course
described by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International's
Committee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking on
the performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in a
prospectus issued about two months ago. 

FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.
In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory work
on intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the three
potential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,
simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures about
intangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staff
accountants' time.  The additional work on intangibles is to focus on
summarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-process
research and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focus
on questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,
security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would not
carry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized.  The board tentatively
set a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by its
staff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitive
decision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project in
early 2002.  

'Minimum Approach' in Performance Reporting Effort
FASB's new rulemaking on performance reporting represents an effort to
improve and make more useful information displayed on all the basic
financial statements, both interim and annual. In such a ""display and
presentation"" project, the board would not address recognition and
measurement questions, according to a staff summary.  FASB's staff
recommended that the board ""stick close"" to what is known as the minimum
approach in the performance reporting project, said Ronald Bossio, a senior
staff project manager. Pursuing that approach was the avenue favored by most
of the board's constituents who expressed support for starting the
standard-setting effort. 

The minimum approach is described by FASB's staff as one that would have the
board ""explore whether certain line items, subtotals, and totals should be
defined in standards and required to be displayed in financial statements,
including interim statements.  ""Line items and amounts that would be
considered include those related to metrics commonly used by investors and
creditors in assessing financial performance,"" the staff continued in a
summary distributed at the board's Oct. 24 meeting. 

Favored less by constituents and not advocated so far by any board member in
preliminary discussions is a broader approach. Under that, FASB would
describe how key financial metrics--usually ratios or some other
indicator--should be calculated if they are presented in financial
statements. However, the methods of figuring such metrics would not be
required to be shown in the financial statements, according to the staff's
summary of the broader path. 

Gary Schieneman, a veteran security analyst who joined FASB in July, said he
supports taking on the project on performance reporting. He added, however,
""I think it will be difficult to stick closely to the minimum approach.""
Michael Crooch, a colleague on the board, said he, too, supports the
rulemaking effort, but voiced a concern that the effort ""may be a project
that has no bounds. This is one we have to watch with regard to scope.""  The
International Accounting Standards Board has begun its own standard-setting
on performance reporting. That task is being carried out jointly with the
United Kingdom's Accounting Standards Board in an effort, in part, toward
helping ensure convergence of financial reporting rules around the world.
FASB plans to monitor the IASB-ASB joint project. 

Defining Simplification
Wulff, a former high-ranking financial executive at Union Carbide who joined
FASB with Schieneman, first raised the issue of perhaps taking on other
projects--revenue recognition and simplification--when he was asked to voice
a view on embarking on the performance reporting project.  what
""simplification"" is came to a head in FASB's debate when Wulff, weighing the
intangible assets project, questioned moving ahead on that effort before
understanding how many staff resources would be used in writing standards on
disclosures about intangibles. 

Some in the community of financial statement preparers--generally U.S.
corporations and their trade groups--oppose FASB's taking on the performance
reporting and intangibles projects. Instead, they suggest the accounting
board should begin rulemaking on liability and revenue recognition and what
the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA) labels ""FASB
Codification/Simplification.""  FASB board members and IASB's liaison to the
U.S. board, James Leisenring, said they know what codification means. The
name signifies a collection of FASB's authoritative literature and GAAP in
general that should be collected in ""one comprehensive format,"" as IMA's
Financial Reporting Committee wrote in a Sept. 19 letter to the accounting
board. 

However, several board members and Leisenring, FASB's former vice chairman,
regarded arguments for simplification warily, as shown by their comments
Oct. 24.  ""I know what codification is,"" said Leisenring. ""I don't know what
simplification is."" He and FASB members Neel Foster and Katherine Schipper
suggested they know what simplification could mean, but did not elaborate,
instead making veiled references to moves such as requiring full fair
value-based recognition of financial instruments in the income statement,
widely opposed by banks and corporations.

Simplification a Complicated Effort
""I also know that isn't what they want,"" Leisenring said of advocates of a
simplification project. He suggested that, if such a project is anything
like IASB's current effort to improve existing international accounting
standards, simplification would prove not so simple--and would consume
hundreds of hours of staff time ""if it's a serious endeavor.""  Foster
labeled arguments that FASB should begin a simplification effort ""an attempt
to tie this organization up for the next 20 years."" 

Schipper, who alone objected to Jenkins's compromise on the intangibles
project, said the board should begin the rulemaking on disclosures about
intangibles ""immediately"" and proceed ""full speed ahead."" 
Schipper cited the lack of comparability in current reporting on purchased
intangible assets, which are accounted for under FASB's new rules on
business combinations, and on intangibles that are internally generated. The
latter and their values often are not reflected at all in financial
statements, although they are said to be key drivers in the so-called ""new
economy."" 

In-process research and development, which figured prominently in mergers
and acquisitions in the high technology sector, ""needs a very strong look,""
she added.  Schipper, a former accounting professor at the University of
Chicago and Duke University, said of accounting for intangibles: ""This issue
has been studied up and down, left and right, ... from floor to ceiling.
""You may think [the academic] research is stupid and misguided. I don't,""
she said in urging a quick start on standard-setting.

Other Action by FASB
In other action at its Oct. 24 meeting, the board tentatively decided to: 

	*	reactivate its dormant project on costs associated with
activities stemming from disposal of a factory or other hard asset used in a
discontinued business operation and reconsider all of the guidance in Issue
No. 94-3 of FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force, ""Liability Recognition for
Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity,""
including one-time employee termination benefits and other restructuring
costs; 

	*	issue draft rules in mid-November to rescind FASB Statement
No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, and to make
miscellaneous technical corrections, including non-substantive changes to
FASB Statement No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and amendments related to FASB
Statements No. 141, Business Combinations, and No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets; and 

	*	consider at an upcoming meeting plans to revive--and most
likely head in a different rulemaking direction than previously pursued--the
board's 20-year-old project on consolidations policy, or defining when an
affiliate of a company should be deemed a subsidiary and have its activities
included in the financial statements of the parent.

In previous incarnations of FASB, an accounting model based on control of an
entity did not garner enough support to advance to a final accounting
standard and was criticized strongly by FEI and others. The control-based
model departed from the traditional majority equity ownership model, which
several FASB members suggest is not followed in current practice despite its
standing as accounting gospel.


Railtrack, Swissair First Test of Europe's Default Swap Market
Bloomberg - October 2001
By Tom Kohn

Europe's $250 billion market for credit default swaps, a form of insurance
against companies missing their debt payments, is getting its first test as
Railtrack Plc and Swissair Group wrestle with insolvency. 

Credit default swaps let banks and other investors juggle the risk that a
bond or loan won't be paid back. The buyer of such protection pays an annual
premium, and the seller pays if there's a so-called credit event, such as a
company going bankrupt. 

``Railtrack is the bigger of the two tests to the overall market,'' said
Dale Lattanzio, head of structured credit trading at Merrill Lynch & Co.
``While the government said the bonds will be OK, under the terms of the
contract it triggered a credit event, and the credit derivatives market is
treating it'' as such. 

Britain's government seized control of Railtrack on Sunday to stop the owner
of the U.K.'s rail network going bankrupt. It would have debts of 700
million pounds ($1 billion) by December and 1.7 billion pounds by March,
government lawyer David Richards told the High Court. Railtrack owes
bondholders more than $2.2 billion. 

Swissair is seeking bankruptcy protection after running out of money Oct. 1.
Europe's seventh-biggest airline owes bondholders $2.6 billion. The
company's market value is currently $48 million, after its shares fell 97
percent this year. 

Settling Claims 

Default swaps traded for both companies, and were triggered by the
announcements. 

``We're going through the process of settling claims,'' said Lattanzio.
``There's a broad agreement in the London-based credit derivatives market,
and it's been fairly orderly with no market disruptions.'' 

Sellers of credit protection aren't likely to refuse to pay out on their
contracts, traders said. Still, because the companies' near-bankruptcies
sparked swap payments it will test the legal contracts on which the banks
rely. 

Credit derivative agreements depend on legal documents developed by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which represents about 540
securities firms. Banks use ISDA contracts for credit default swaps to
ensure their agreements won't collapse if unexpected events occur. 

ISDA defines a credit event as ``bankruptcy, failure to pay, obligation
default, obligation acceleration, repudiation or moratorium, and
restructuring.'' 

``The likelihood is that the documentation should stand up,'' said Ruth
Ainslie, senior policy director at ISDA in New York. She said that depends
if banks used ISDA agreements and ``whether or not they have been radically
changed.'' ISDA has received legal opinions on Swiss and U.K. jurisdiction,
because ISDA contracts cover a ``very broad range'' of agreements, she said.


`Consternation' 

The U.K. government plans to transfer Railtrack's bonds into a new company,
rated at least ``BBB'' by Standard & Poor's and ``Baa2'' by Moody's.
Bondholders would get interest and be repaid when the debt matures at
``broadly'' the same terms, Transport Secretary Stephen Byers said this
week. 

``Initially there was consternation when Railtrack was put into
receivership,'' said Ned Swan, a partner and derivatives specialist at law
firm Simmons & Simmons. Still, ``it's a major company with major assets. It
was a surprise, but these things will be worked out.'' 

The Bank of England estimates the credit derivatives market has a face value
of about $1 trillion, with credit default swaps accounting for about half
the market. London trading accounts for ``just under'' half the market. Up
to 2,000 swaps on companies are traded, with 500 to 1,000 trading
``actively.'' the bank said in a June report. 

The central bank cited British Bankers' Association and U.S. government
figures as well as its own estimates. The U.S. Office for the Comptroller of
the Currency reported U.S. commercial banks had credit derivatives with a
face value of $351 billion at the end of the second quarter. 

U.K. securities watchdog the Financial Services Authority monitors the banks
trading credit default swaps, though doesn't regulate credit derivatives. 

``We don't regulate it as a product,'' said Karin Loudon, an FSA
spokeswoman. ``It's up to the banks to manage their own legal risk.'' 

UBS AG sued Deutsche Bank AG for $10 million at Britain's high court in
March for failing to pay on a default swap when Armstrong World Industries
Inc., the U.S.'s biggest vinyl-flooring maker, defaulted on its debt. 

The dispute centered on Armstrong's name, because the contract referred to
its parent company, Armstrong Holdings Inc., according to the court filing.
The two banks settled the suit March 15. An FSA spokesman said at the time
that regulators don't typically intervene in such cases because banks
usually resolve disputes among themselves. 


Canada Publishes Final Regulations To Implement Financial Services Framework

BNA - October 25, 2001

OTTAWA--The Canadian government has implemented new framework legislation
for the financial services sector, including domestic and foreign banks,
trust companies, insurance companies, credit unions and other financial
institutions, Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions)
James Peterson said Oct. 24. 

Implementation of Bill C-8, An Act to establish the Financial Consumer
Agency of Canada and to amend certain Acts in relation to financial
institutions, coincides with the publication of a finalized package of
regulations necessary to give effect to the legislation's provisions,
Peterson said in a statement. 

""The measures contained in Bill C-8 will help to ensure that the Canadian
financial services sector continues to be among the safest and most
accessible in the world,"" he said. ""The legislation will promote efficiency
and growth in the sector, foster international competitiveness and domestic
competition, empower and protect consumers of financial services, and
improve the regulatory environment."" 

The legislation also creates the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, which
begins operations Oct. 24 and will enforce compliance with the legislation's
consumer provisions and educate consumers on how the legislation benefits
them, he said. The new agency has been in the public spotlight recently as a
necessary element of the federal government's efforts to track down and
freeze assets in Canada of international terrorist organizations. 

The Department of Finance published the finalized package of 75 regulations
in the Oct. 24, 2001 issue of the Canada Gazette, Part II. The regulations
are particularly important because a key element of the new financial
framework is the use of regulations to provide a more flexible regulatory
environment for the financial sector, said a regulatory impact analysis
statement published with the finalized regulations. 

""This allows the government to make modest policy adjustments to the
framework in response to significant changes taking place in the global
environment in which financial institutions operate. Many regulations are
being proposed or modified in order to achieve this policy objective of
creating a more flexible regulatory regime,"" the impact analysis statement
said. 

The current proposals are the first of several packages of regulations that
will be brought forward to implement the policy intent of the new Act, and
will include regulations essential to operation of the legislation, it said.


Of the 75 regulations, 37 relate to the new framework's restructuring of the
permitted investment regime, while 18 are related to the new holding company
regime for financial institutions, six relate to creation of the new
Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, six relate to changes to the foreign
bank regime and the remaining eight are aimed at various other policy
objectives, it said. 

Key areas of the regulations relate to the activities of banks include: 


	*	definition of ""aggregate financial exposure"" for banks
engaging in certain transactions with related parties that are not federally
regulated financial institutions; 

	*	limits on the commercial lending activities of financial
institutions other than banks; 

	*	requirements for financial institutions to inform customers
with a complaint about a product or service on how to contact the Financial
Consumer Agency of Canada; 

	*	exemption of certain classes of entities from the status of
being an entity associated with a foreign bank and exemption of certain
classes of entities from the definition of foreign bank; 

	*	definition of the term ""equity"" when used in dealing with
ownership rules for banks and demutualized insurance companies; 

	*	rules on the investment powers of entities in which a
financial institution holds more than 10 percent of the voting shares or 25
percent of the equity, but not control; 

	*	definition of ""financial leasing""; 

	*	prescription of a range of information-processing activities
permitted for banks and authorized foreign banks, including payroll
processing, clearing and management of deposit accounts; 

	*	prescribed limits for the amounts of real property and
equity investments permitted for financial institutions; 

	*	rules governing the ability of an entity to identify itself
as a member of a group in describing its corporate relationship with a
foreign bank; 

	*	prohibitions that apply to a foreign bank's real property
activities outside of its authorized foreign bank branch; 

	*	rules governing the content of a prospectus; 

	*	expansion of the scope of commercial companies in which
financial institutions are permitted to invest, subject to a number of
constraints and caps; and 

	*	provisions permitting regulated securities entities to hold
shares of a parent bank holding company to a limit of one percent of the
bank holding company's regulatory capital.

End Of Cantor Treasurys Quotes On Telerate Causes Bother
Dow Jones - October 25, 2001
TOKYO -- Some Japanese institutional investors were a little peeved Thursday
when information provider Telerate stopped offering Treasurys' pricing from
major inter-dealer broker Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, but the change
hasn't hampered trading of U.S. government debt, said Tokyo traders.

Telerate, owned by Moneyline, stopped posting Cantor Fitzgerald real-time
U.S. Treasury bond pricing on its screens globally from 5:00 p.m. EDT
Wednesday. The information and data provider said it would replace the
service with price quotes from rival inter-dealer broker BrokerTec Global
LLC. But as of 0700 GMT (3:00 a.m. EDT Thursday) the display remained blank.
The reason for the change wasn't immediately clear.
""Investors have called in to say it's inconvenient that they can't check the
Cantor page (on Telerate) and have asked about prices,"" said a foreign
securities house trader in Tokyo. ""They are now logging onto the Cantor's
website or having to set up a Cantor page on a Bloomberg terminal.""

Apart from a bit of hassle suffered by some investors, however, impact on
trading was limited.
Even with comprehensive on-screen price data investors will typically phone
up several brokerages to get bond price quotes before deciding to trade,
said a trader at a large Japanese insurance company. Losing access to price
indications wouldn't change that practice, he added.

Brokerage and bank Treasurys dealers, and their colleagues in the swaps
market, were unaffected as apparently none of them rely solely on the
Telerate service for U.S. debt security pricing information, traders said.
Telerate continues to provide limited non real-time U.S. government bond
pricing data from Cantor Fitzgerald and other brokers on a separate display.


The Case for Catastrophe Bonds
The New York Times - October 25, 2001
By Hal R. Varian

The insurance industry faces claims of at least $40 billion tied to the
World Trade Center attacks, and it remains exposed to significant risk from
future incidents. Retail insurance companies are considering exclusions for
terrorist damage, leaving property owners unable to buy the coverage they
need.

The problem lies in the reinsurance industry, the wholesale market where
insurers lay off large risks to pools of investors willing to absorb them.
Warren E. Buffett's reinsurance company, General Re, has done well in the
last few years offering property reinsurance because there have not been
major hurricanes or earthquakes. But its luck ran out last month: General Re
has said it is liable for over $2 billion of the total industry losses in
the Sept. 11 attacks.

Earthquakes and hurricanes, unpleasant as they are, present manageable
risks: insurers know roughly how often they occur in various places, what
their likely magnitudes are and how much property damage might be expected.

Terrorist risk is much harder to quantify, leading to the current paralysis
in the reinsurance market. The insurance industry has been lobbying in
Washington to make the federal government the insurer of last resort against
terrorism, which means that taxpayers will end up bearing the financial risk
of future attacks.

Britain adopted a government-backed reinsurance market several years ago
and, so far, it has worked reasonably well. But there is another way to
supplement traditional reinsurance markets that has been attracting
increasing attention: catastrophe bonds. These bonds, generally sold to
large institutions, have typically been tied to natural disasters, like
earthquakes or hurricanes, but they could, in principle, be used to provide
financial backing for terrorism insurance.

Here is how they work. A financial intermediary, like a reinsurance company
or an investment bank, issues a bond tied to a particular insurable event,
like a Los Angeles earthquake. If there is no earthquake, investors are paid
a generous interest rate. But if the earthquake occurs and the claims exceed
an amount specified in the bond, investors sacrifice their principal and
interest.

How generous does the interest rate have to be? That is left up to the
market. If the bond sales offer cheaper reinsurance coverage than do
traditional private placements used in the reinsurance market, these bonds,
known as cat bonds, are a preferred method of finance.

Cat bonds are a form of ""contingent security,"" a concept first formulated by
Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, winner of the 1972 Nobel in
economic science. 

Back in 1952, Professor Arrow came up with the idea of a security that would
pay a fixed amount of money depending on whether or not some event occurred.
He showed that portfolios of such contingent securities could be used to
allocate virtually any kind of risk in an efficient manner.

The analysis by Professor Arrow was long thought to be of only theoretical
interest. But it turned out that all sorts of options and other derivatives
could be best understood using contingent securities. Now Wall Street rocket
scientists draw on this 50-year-old work when creating exotic new
derivatives.

There are a number of special cases of contingent securities. Consider a
security tied to my house burning down. This would certainly affect my net
worth, but would have negligible impact on the owners of the other 70
million housing units in the United States.

This kind of personal risk can easily be shared among many people, each
paying only a small amount if the event occurs, and homeowners insurance is
to ease this kind of risk sharing.

This works fine for small independent risks, but there are other sorts of
events that impose large costs on many people at the same time, like
earthquakes or hurricanes. Insurance companies are able to deal with such
events using reinsurance markets, where the risk is transferred to large
investors.

There are other financial institutions that also allow for risk transfer for
this sort of widespread risk. The orange juice futures market in Chicago is
essentially a market in a contingent security tied to whether it freezes in
Orlando, Fla.

A futures market allows market participants who bear a significant risk
(like farmers worried that their crop might be destroyed) to transfer some
of that risk to others, who are, of course, paid to absorb it. The futures
market allows shifting of risk rather than a simple sharing of risk.

Risk sharing and risk shifting are familiar terms, but there is another
phenomenon worth noting, something I like to call ""risk shafting."" This is
when some risk - often a particularly large risk - is transferred to a third
party who is forced to bear it involuntarily.

In many cases, these third parties are taxpayers, who are not even aware of
their potential liability.

Hence the debate that is going on in Washington now: should the insurance
industry be able to transfer the risk from future terrorist attacks to
taxpayers? Or would it be better to use existing reinsurance markets or new
financial instruments like catastrophe bonds to shift the risk to those
willing and able to bear it if appropriately compensated?

Cat bonds have some attractive features. They can spread risks widely and
can be subdivided indefinitely, allowing each investor to bear only a small
part of the risk. The money backing up the insurance is paid in advance, so
there is no default risk to the insured.

As the market for cat bonds matures, secondary markets may develop,
particularly if the bonds become standardized and bundled into portfolios.
If so, the market price of cat bonds will reflect the market perceptions of
the likelihood of the event associated with the bond, just as price changes
on the orange juice futures market reflect the likelihood of a freeze in
Florida.

The market for cat bonds is still immature, and is only a fraction of the
size of traditional reinsurance. But cat bonds and other sorts of contingent
securities may well end up being part of the long-run solution to the
problems of the reinsurance industry.

Senior management here, and elsewhere no doubt, have lots of questions about constraints on the business going forward, what could prevent merger taking place etc. etc. Is it planned that summaries of key provisions be prepared centrally and circulated?

(DYN)ENE Deal Shows Risk Coverage & Est & Valuation UpsideSummaryAfter the close on Friday, DYN confirmed that it would acquire Enron (ENE, 8.63,Strong Buy) for 0.2685 DYN shares plus assumption of debt and an equity infusionof $2.5 billion. This values ENE at $10.40 per share based on DYN's Fridayclose.Our initial analyses show the merger to be additive to pro-forma '02 eps for DYNby 25% to $3.25-$3.30 vs our current estimate of $2.55. We estimate the dealmultiples as about 7x '02 eps, 3.2x '02 cash flow, 0.85x book value and 5xEV/EBITDA based on our revised '02 estimates for ENE.We would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per sharebefore cost savings and synergies.We expect the deal to close in 9-12 months pending reviews by the SEC, FTC, FERCand state PSCs. Despite the size of the combined company, we do not expect majordivestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration andthe inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.In a report dated Nov 5, we valued ENE at $31 per share. In our view, the dealvaluation includes a differential of $20 per share or $17 billion to account forENEs related party and accounting issues. Because these issues threatened ENEscore businesses, the timing and valuation of the deal for DYN is extraordinarilyattractive. We consider alternate bids for ENE to be possible under thesecircumstances.We expect DYN and other energy merchants to benefit from the removal of riskthat ENE would be downgraded below investment grade or file for bankruptcyprotection.Pending additional information from conference calls, analyst meetings and otherdeal related filings; we are maintaining our reported eps ests for DYN of $2.10for '01 and $2.55 for '02. Our ENE ests are $1.80 for '01 and $1.60 for '02.These estimates assume the deal closes in 4Q'02.Price        Target                     Mkt.

We would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per share

""The ConvertiblesSupplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents inthe credit derivatives markets, including portfolio managers, creditprotection sellers and dealers,"" said Robert G. Pickel, Executive Directorand CEO of ISDA.ISDA Debuts Credit Derivatives Number at $631.5 billion in OTC Market SurveyISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and DerivativesAssociation (ISDA) announced today that the global notional outstandingvolume of credit derivatives transactions was $631.497 billion for the firsthalf of 2001. While still modest in relation to interest rate products, thisfigure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to moremature derivative product areas.Polling member firms for the first time on credit derivatives transactions,ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name creditdefault swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to ten credits, and portfoliotransactions of ten credits and more. 83 ISDA member firms supplied data onthese products. Interest rate and currency derivatives growth was 3.573% inthe first half of the year among members that also reported to ISDA atyear-end 2000. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes increasedfrom $53.267 trillion to $55.170 trillion. Total notional principle ofinterest rate swaps, interest rate options and currency swaps for allsurveyed firms dipped to $57.305 trillion from $63.009 trillion last year.Among top ten dealers, there was also a minor decrease in volume from$35.648 trillion to $35.532 trillion.""Shifting product use is a reflection of a more uncertain global marketenvironment,"" said Thomas K. Montag, Vice-Chairman of ISDA and Chair of theAssociation's Market Survey Committee. ""The market for credit protection hasan obvious appeal during times of economic downturn,"" said Mr Montag, aManaging Director of Global Interest Rate Products and Asia FICC, andCo-President of Goldman Sachs (Japan), Ltd.The survey, which is compiled twice yearly by Andersen LLP, is performed ona confidential basis. It is complemented by the more comprehensive surveyproduced quarterly by the Bank for International Settlements. Of the 83member institutions providing outstanding notional volumes figures in theISDA interest rate and currency derivatives survey, 67 were participants inthe previous semi-annual survey.Isda reports growth in credit protectionFinancial News - November 12, 2001Available upon request - smarra@isda.org <mailto:smarra@isda.org>Supranational Studies First Use Of Credit Derivatives Derivatives Week - November 12, 2001The European Investment Bank, a multinational lender with a EUR215 billion(USD192 billion) loan portfolio, is considering using credit derivatives forthe first time as a means of hedging its credit risks next year. Officialsat the EIB in Luxembourg said the lender is currently conducting an internalreview on the credit derivatives market and is weighing whether it makessense to use products such as single-name default swaps to mitigate risk.""Credit [derivatives] would be a completely new field for us,"" said LuisPacheco, an official in the credit-risk department in Luxembourg, noting thebank has used foreign exchange swaps in the past on the back of its bondofferings but has not used any derivatives on its loan portfolio. The lender hands out EUR36 billion per year, EUR30 billion of which iswithin the European Union, to highly rated banks and corporates. Two-thirdsof the loans go to highly-rated banks with credit ratings in the A rangewith maturities of 15-25 years, which then loan money to small andmedium-sized enterprises. The remaining third goes to corporates across thecredit spectrum in five to 15-year tenors. Pacheco said the EIB will accept default swaps in place of bank guarantees,which it now requires as a means of hedging risk on the bulk of itslong-term lending, if the market is deemed liquid enough. Officials wereunable to quantify potential usage of credit derivatives given the earlystage of the discussions. Credit derivatives pros were excited to hear of the EIB's discussions. ""It'sjust a matter of time until the credit derivatives market becomes more likethe interest-rate swaps market and what we're seeing now is the initialphase,"" said one trader, adding, ""I'm not surprised."" Pacheco and other EIB officials said the reason behind the review is becausethe default swap market is more liquid and as a result may offer moreattractive pricing for debtors. ""The advantage is the portfolio approach,""commented one official.

ISDA Publishes Credit Publishes Credit Derivatives Convertibles Supplement
ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001
<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>

NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association announced today that it has finalized and published the
Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations.
The Supplement and Commentary can be accessed under the What's New section
of the ISDA's web site. 

The Convertibles Supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA
Credit Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and
exchangeable obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations,
such as zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and
non-discounted bonds that accrete during their term.  ""The Convertibles
Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of constituents in
the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio managers, credit
protection sellers and dealers,"" said Robert G. Pickel, Executive Director
and CEO of ISDA.


ISDA Debuts Credit Derivatives Number at $631.5 billion in OTC Market Survey
ISDA Press Release - November 9, 2001
<http://www.isda.org/whatsnew/index.html>

NEW YORK, Friday, November 9, 2001 - The International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (ISDA) announced today that the global notional outstanding
volume of credit derivatives transactions was $631.497 billion for the first
half of 2001. While still modest in relation to interest rate products, this
figure is expected to remain on a strong upward trend compared to more
mature derivative product areas.

Polling member firms for the first time on credit derivatives transactions,
ISDA surveyed total notional outstanding volumes for single name credit
default swaps, default swaps on baskets of up to ten credits, and portfolio
transactions of ten credits and more. 83 ISDA member firms supplied data on
these products. Interest rate and currency derivatives growth was 3.573% in
the first half of the year among members that also reported to ISDA at
year-end 2000. For these firms, total notional outstanding volumes increased
from $53.267 trillion to $55.170 trillion. Total notional principle of
interest rate swaps, interest rate options and currency swaps for all
surveyed firms dipped to $57.305 trillion from $63.009 trillion last year.
Among top ten dealers, there was also a minor decrease in volume from
$35.648 trillion to $35.532 trillion.

""Shifting product use is a reflection of a more uncertain global market
environment,"" said Thomas K. Montag, Vice-Chairman of ISDA and Chair of the
Association's Market Survey Committee. ""The market for credit protection has
an obvious appeal during times of economic downturn,"" said Mr Montag, a
Managing Director of Global Interest Rate Products and Asia FICC, and
Co-President of Goldman Sachs (Japan), Ltd.

The survey, which is compiled twice yearly by Andersen LLP, is performed on
a confidential basis. It is complemented by the more comprehensive survey
produced quarterly by the Bank for International Settlements. Of the 83
member institutions providing outstanding notional volumes figures in the
ISDA interest rate and currency derivatives survey, 67 were participants in
the previous semi-annual survey.

Supranational Studies First Use Of Credit Derivatives 
Derivatives Week - November 12, 2001

The European Investment Bank, a multinational lender with a EUR215 billion
(USD192 billion) loan portfolio, is considering using credit derivatives for
the first time as a means of hedging its credit risks next year. Officials
at the EIB in Luxembourg said the lender is currently conducting an internal
review on the credit derivatives market and is weighing whether it makes
sense to use products such as single-name default swaps to mitigate risk.
""Credit [derivatives] would be a completely new field for us,"" said Luis
Pacheco, an official in the credit-risk department in Luxembourg, noting the
bank has used foreign exchange swaps in the past on the back of its bond
offerings but has not used any derivatives on its loan portfolio. 

The lender hands out EUR36 billion per year, EUR30 billion of which is
within the European Union, to highly rated banks and corporates. Two-thirds
of the loans go to highly-rated banks with credit ratings in the A range
with maturities of 15-25 years, which then loan money to small and
medium-sized enterprises. The remaining third goes to corporates across the
credit spectrum in five to 15-year tenors. 

Pacheco said the EIB will accept default swaps in place of bank guarantees,
which it now requires as a means of hedging risk on the bulk of its
long-term lending, if the market is deemed liquid enough. Officials were
unable to quantify potential usage of credit derivatives given the early
stage of the discussions. 

Credit derivatives pros were excited to hear of the EIB's discussions. ""It's
just a matter of time until the credit derivatives market becomes more like
the interest-rate swaps market and what we're seeing now is the initial
phase,"" said one trader, adding, ""I'm not surprised."" 

Pacheco and other EIB officials said the reason behind the review is because
the default swap market is more liquid and as a result may offer more
attractive pricing for debtors. ""The advantage is the portfolio approach,""
commented one official. The EIB has considered using credit derivatives in
the past, although it found ""the market was not developed enough and so we
were not interested,"" said Pacheco. The supranational is analyzing the
market now to see if that has changed in terms of liquidity and critical
mass in the last year as is expected. ""Now we want to see the new situation
of the market and to see if we can use it in our business,"" he said. He
declined comment on potential counterparties. 


Basle study suggests changes to the Accord
IFR - November 10, 2001

Banks could face higher capital charges under Basle II's internal ratings
based (IRB) foundation approach to credit risk reserving than its more
advanced, standardised approach.

Contrary to the Baste Committee on Banking Supervision's desired results,
the IRB foundation approach's minimum capital requirements would be 14%
higher among large G-1O banks, the regulators' quantitative impact study
(QIS) found.

Under the standardised approach, these banks would see their requirements
increase 6% on average. An average change of - 5% was reached when banks
were asked to calibrate credit risk using the IRB advanced approach laid out
in the Committee's January proposal, according to the QIS released last
week.

To address the fact that the approach slated as the less intensive yielded
higher charges, and to understand better the impact that the January
proposal would have on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the
Committee is conducting a follow-on impact study.

The January proposal's corporate and retail risk weight curves and its
method for recognition of physical collateral and receivables may be
modified as a result of this study, the regulator said last week. The
January draft was not balanced because it was biased towards the views of
large banks engaged in large corporate lending activities, noted one
industry official.

The corporate risk weight curve under the new QIS is likely to reduce the
capital requirements for many SME borrowers relative to the January
proposal, the Committee said. Additional work is also under way aimed at
assessing the probable impact of applying separate risk weight curves for
residential mortgage exposures and for other retail exposures. Under the
Committee's January proposal, the IRB approach treated all retail exposures
using the same risk weight curve.

The impact of assuming a 45% loss-given default (LGD) for loans fully
secured by non-property physical collateral and a 40% LCD for loans fully
secured by receivables will be examined in the new QIS.  ""Under the January
proposal banks with the foundation approach have no incentive to use most
forms of collateral,"" said Marc Intrater, managing director at Oliver, Wyman
in New York.

Other than commercial and residential property collateral, the January
proposal did not recognise physical collateral or trade receivables as
collateral. As such, loans fully secured by either received a 50% LGD. Banks
that use collateral for their secured lending and do it well generally
experience a reduction in credit risk. The Committee's decision to undertake
a follow-up impact exercise is widely viewed as revisionist, say market
participants. Similar moves earlier this year appear poised to result in
changes to the January proposal, they note.

""There is a lot of waiting until the final accord. But most banks realise
that even though the accord does not come into effect until 2005, getting
ready for it requires a lot of lead time,"" said Intrater. The Baste
Committee plans to release a final version of its proposed accord in
February.

Today, all of the business units within Enron will be holding floor meetings to discuss the pending merger and it's implications for Enron.  I encourage each of you to participate in one of these meetings.  

The announcement of the deal with Dynegy marks a significant event in removing some of the uncertainties we've all dealt with over the past several weeks.  As decisions are made regarding the future of the company and specific business units, we will be able to determine and communicate the future of the Program.

New opportunities will be created from the changes that are occurring.  The very best talent from both organizations will rise to the top, and our Associates and Analysts will be a key part of our future success.

I appreciate your continued efforts and patience during this difficult time.

***POLL***
THIS WEEK'S POLL:
Does your company have a customer privacy policy?
Let us know!
http://www.informationsecurityworld.com/Tmpl/Archpolls.asp?CID=16

RESULTS OF LAST WEEK'S POLL:
Would you lend your biometric info to a friend?
51.4% Yes
48.6% No

***PORTAL DISCUSSION***
A recent survey has found that 56% percent of people would be willing to share their fingerprint or eyeball identification to enter public or corporate buildings, while 35% are concerned about sacrificing their privacy for better security. Why is this? 

Here's what you're saying:
""Passwords are readily transferable. You introduce biometrics to eliminate ""sharing"". This can be made impossible by storing biometrics on a secure token and implementing a token match process. No database storage required!! Then only you can access your entitlement. Simple!""

""I think somehow that you have missed the point. Using biometrics to limit administrative access on your network would work using your ""simple"" proposition but the question refers more to the problem of physical access.

The integration of the two p=latforms will take about six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, =the two will continue to operate separately. On both EnronOnline and Dynegy=direct, traders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively.=20Analysis: This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging in=tegration of the various businesses between Dynegy and Enron. Although the =merger makes sense for both companies, especially considering Enron's finan=cial instability and its limited options at this juncture, it must be ackno=wledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures, and =the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task. The= companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading, as ill=ustrated by their independent electronic exchanges. Although it will be int=eresting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate =their two separate customer accounts, one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegy=direct have in common is that they rely on principal-based transactions.=20It is important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when i=t developed EnronOnline, the first electronic-trading exchange, well ahead =of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydire=ct about a year later. The latest available information indicates that Enro=nOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 billion in notional valu=e. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 bill=ion in notional transactions. Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnli=ne, led by electricity and natural gas, but also including bandwidth and pa=per. EnronOnline is a proprietary trading exchange. In other words, in ever=y transaction that takes place on EnronOnline, Enron participates as either= a buyer or a seller.=20Dynegydirect was launched in October 2000, a year after EnronOnline became =operational. Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline, although it is =growing. The exchange recorded nearly $10 billion in transactions in the th=ird quarter. Like EnronOnline, Dynegydirect is also principal-based. In oth=er words, Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions, either as a b=uyer or a seller. Unlike EnronOnline, which is completely online, Dynegydir=ect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the tel=ephone. It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved i=n two different kinds of online trading. The first is the proprietary, one-=to-many format on Dynegydirect, in which Dynegy participates in all transac=tions as either a buyer or a seller. The second venue is an anonymous, many=-to-many format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and= sellers. This operation takes place on TradeSpark. Dynegy had previously i=nvested $25 million in eSpeed, the trading systems developer that created t=he infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates.=20As a whole, the online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a ma=jor growth spurt. A study conducted by AMR Research showed that 600 energy-=trading exchanges existed in April 2000. This number grew to 1,500 by Septe=mber 2001. A separate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that= online trading in wholesale markets increased 750 percent from 1999 to 200=0. The same report projects that online trading volume will continue to gro=w, leaping from a $400-billion market in 2000 to a $3.6-trillion market in =2005. Without question, the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a =market edge in many sectors of the energy industry, including the online tr=ading market.=20SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan=20[News item from Energy Info Source] A federal judge on Nov. 9 refused to de=lay a settlement between Southern California Edison (SCE) and state regulat=ors designed to allow the utility to recover $3.3 billion of its debts and =to keep it from bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying th=e deal, as requested by a consumer group, would risk harming the state's se=cond-largest utility, its creditors and the public. Judge Lew, who approved= the settlement on Oct. 5, called the arguments for a stay advanced by cons=umer group The Utility Reform Network (TURN) ""repetitive"" and ""without meri=t.""=20Analysis: This is a victory for SCE in the painstaking process of establish=ing a rescue plan for the utility with the state of California. Two weeks a=go, a federal appeals court had temporarily blocked a settlement between SC=E and state power regulators that would keep electric rates at record highs= for the next two years.

Updates on Enron / Dynegy Merger, SCE Rescue Plan and Muni Vote in San Fran=

cisco





By Will McNamara

Director, Electric Industry Analysis





[Today's column includes analysis on three separate news items.]=20



EnronOnline and Dynegydirect to Merge=20



[News item from Energy Info Source] Online energy trading EnronOnline will =

merge with smaller rival Dynegydirect after its parent company Enron Corp. =

agreed to a $9-billion takeover by Dynegy Inc. The integration of the two p=

latforms will take about six to nine months, Dynegy said. In the meantime, =

the two will continue to operate separately. On both EnronOnline and Dynegy=

direct, traders can only deal with Enron and Dynegy, respectively.=20



Analysis: This is the first step in what may ultimately be a challenging in=

tegration of the various businesses between Dynegy and Enron. Although the =

merger makes sense for both companies, especially considering Enron's finan=

cial instability and its limited options at this juncture, it must be ackno=

wledged that the two companies have very different corporate cultures, and =

the process of conjoining those different cultures may be a major task. The=

 companies have developed two distinct approaches to online trading, as ill=

ustrated by their independent electronic exchanges. Although it will be int=

eresting to see how the separate exchanges become conjoined and assimilate =

their two separate customer accounts, one thing that EnronOnline and Dynegy=

direct have in common is that they rely on principal-based transactions.=20



It is important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when i=

t developed EnronOnline, the first electronic-trading exchange, well ahead =

of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend and created Dynegydire=

ct about a year later. The latest available information indicates that Enro=

nOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 billion in notional valu=

e. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 bill=

ion in notional transactions. Enron trades various commodities on EnronOnli=

ne, led by electricity and natural gas, but also including bandwidth and pa=

per. EnronOnline is a proprietary trading exchange. In other words, in ever=

y transaction that takes place on EnronOnline, Enron participates as either=

 a buyer or a seller.=20



Dynegydirect was launched in October 2000, a year after EnronOnline became =

operational. Dynegydirect is much smaller than EnronOnline, although it is =

growing. The exchange recorded nearly $10 billion in transactions in the th=

ird quarter. Like EnronOnline, Dynegydirect is also principal-based. In oth=

er words, Dynegy is a participant in all of the transactions, either as a b=

uyer or a seller. Unlike EnronOnline, which is completely online, Dynegydir=

ect allows customers to conduct their transactions with Dynegy over the tel=

ephone. It is important to note that Dynegy strategically became involved i=

n two different kinds of online trading. The first is the proprietary, one-=

to-many format on Dynegydirect, in which Dynegy participates in all transac=

tions as either a buyer or a seller. The second venue is an anonymous, many=

-to-many format in which Dynegy participates along with multiple buyers and=

 sellers. This operation takes place on TradeSpark. Dynegy had previously i=

nvested $25 million in eSpeed, the trading systems developer that created t=

he infrastructure on which TradeSpark operates.=20



As a whole, the online trading market appears to be riding the wave of a ma=

jor growth spurt. A study conducted by AMR Research showed that 600 energy-=

trading exchanges existed in April 2000. This number grew to 1,500 by Septe=

mber 2001. A separate report conducted by Forrester Research indicates that=

 online trading in wholesale markets increased 750 percent from 1999 to 200=

0. The same report projects that online trading volume will continue to gro=

w, leaping from a $400-billion market in 2000 to a $3.6-trillion market in =

2005. Without question, the combined force of Enron and Dynegy will gain a =

market edge in many sectors of the energy industry, including the online tr=

ading market.=20





SCE Allowed to Proceed with Rescue Plan=20



[News item from Energy Info Source] A federal judge on Nov. 9 refused to de=

lay a settlement between Southern California Edison (SCE) and state regulat=

ors designed to allow the utility to recover $3.3 billion of its debts and =

to keep it from bankruptcy. U.S. District Judge Ronald Lew said delaying th=

e deal, as requested by a consumer group, would risk harming the state's se=

cond-largest utility, its creditors and the public. Judge Lew, who approved=

 the settlement on Oct. 5, called the arguments for a stay advanced by cons=

umer group The Utility Reform Network (TURN) ""repetitive"" and ""without meri=

t.""=20



Analysis: This is a victory for SCE in the painstaking process of establish=

ing a rescue plan for the utility with the state of California. Two weeks a=

go, a federal appeals court had temporarily blocked a settlement between SC=

E and state power regulators that would keep electric rates at record highs=

 for the next two years. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted TURN=

 two weeks to argue against the settlement. The settlement would help SCE, =

the state's second-largest utility, pay more than half of its estimated $6-=

billion debt by continuing to charge Edison customers higher rates imposed =

last May. The judge's decision now has blocked any additional counter claim=

s by TURN, at least on the current judicial level, and it appears that SCE =

is free to move forward with its CPUC-endorsed rescue plan.=20



It is important to note that the original settlement deal between SCE and t=

he state of California emerged out of negotiations that had taken place bet=

ween SCE and the CPUC in an effort to resolve previous litigation. SCE had =

sued state regulators at the CPUC after they refused to allow the utility t=

o raise rates and recover billions of dollars it had spent buying power on =

behalf of customers at soaring prices in the wholesale market. SCE's lawsui=

t argued that the regulators broke federal law and unconstitutionally took =

its property by not letting it bill customers for the full cost of their el=

ectricity. At the present time, SCE's total debt is marked at about $6.35 b=

illion in power procurement-related liabilities due to state law that prohi=

bited it from recovering the high costs of wholesale electricity through re=

tail electric rates. Under the agreement reached between SCE and the CPUC, =

SCE would be allowed to pay down about $3 billion of its back debt of $6.35=

 billion.=20



In exchange for being protected from bankruptcy proceedings, SCE agreed to =

a rate freeze and a promise by utility executives to not pay shareholders a=

 dividend until the debt is paid off. SCE's rates were raised by approximat=

ely 42 percent in 2001 and will remain frozen through 2003 unless the utili=

ty pays off its debts sooner. In exchange, SCE agreed it would use cash on =

hand and any revenue beyond what it needs to cover operating expenses to pa=

y off its old debts; pay no dividends on its common stock through 2003 or u=

ntil its back debts are fully paid; and drop a lawsuit against state regula=

tors claiming the CPUC had violated federal law by failing to raise retail =

rates to reflect the underlying cost of wholesale power. From its perspecti=

ve, officials at Edison International (the parent company of SCE) expressed=

 confidence that the settlement deal would allow the utility to accumulate =

enough cash and gain financing by the middle of the first fiscal quarter of=

 2002 to pay its debt to banks, bondholders and power generators.=20





Tally of Absentee Ballots Changes San Francisco Municipalization Vote=20



[News item from Reuters] Two ballot measures aimed at establishing a public=

 power system in San Francisco and unplugging utility Pacific Gas & Electri=

c Co. have gone down in defeat, officials said on Nov. 12.=20



Analysis: The tally of absentee ballots in the Nov. 6 municipalization vote=

 in San Francisco changed at least part of the outcome in this election. As=

 noted in a previous IssueAlert, Proposition I, which sought to set up a Mu=

nicipal Utility District in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane, was def=

eated. However, originally it was believed that the separate measure known =

as Proposition F, which would have established a Municipal Water and Power =

Agency in San Francisco alone, had passed by a slim margin. Upon counting t=

he absentee ballots, the San Francisco Department of Elections announced th=

at this measure was defeated by a scant 533 votes.=20



Obviously, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. is quite pleased with the revised out=

come of this election. In response to the finalized vote, representatives f=

rom the utility said, ""This outcome affirms that there is no strong sentime=

nt in favor of the takeover of PG&E's distribution system in San Francisco.=

"" There may be some validity to this statement, considering that one could =

argue that with the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric and the recent Cal=

ifornia energy crisis, conditions could have favored a pro-municipalization=

 vote, and yet the measure still failed. However, let's not forget that it =

was defeated by only 533 votes, which indicates that the issue regarding th=

e establishment of a public power system in the area is far from over.=20



The defeat of the municipalization issue in San Francisco can be attributed=

 to several factors. First, it must be acknowledged that PG&E Corp., the pa=

rent company of bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric, spent about $1 million on =

advertising to defeat the measure. However, arguably voters responded to cl=

aims by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. that the municipalization plan was unrea=

listic. The utility claimed that a (MUD) Municipal Utility would be ill-equ=

ipped to handle the complex electricity infrastructure that Pacific Gas & E=

lectric has managed for years, and that a city-run bureaucracy would not be=

 able to compete with big league energy players. In addition, the new MUD w=

ould have to purchase Pacific Gas & Electric's transmission assets and also=

 buy wholesale power without the benefit of long-term contracts, which repr=

esent two hefty investments that would end up costing consumers in the long=

 run.=20

Pickel,ISDA's executive director and CEO. Credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default onobligations like bonds or loans, or other types of credit events like a debtrestructuring. They have had a growing influence in the broader fixed-incomeuniverse, at times playing a role in the pricing of corporate bonds. And some convertible-bond investors will lay off the credit risk from thefixed-income portion of a convertible security by buying credit default swapprotection. ISDA's supplement was expected. A group of U.S.-based dealers submitted aproposal to ISDA a few months ago to include obligations like convertiblebonds as deliverable securities in these contracts. And in mid-October, ISDA told members that convertible bonds weredeliverable under standard credit derivatives contracts. The group'smemorandum to members came in response to questions from members followingthe appointment of a railway administrator for Railtrack PLC (U.RTK). Holders of convertible bonds issued by Railtrack had complained that somesellers of credit protection weren't paying claims on default swap contractson the Railtrack credit. The Basel perplexThe Economist - November 8, 2001The arcane world of banking supervision is not usually the talk of Germanchancellors on tours of Asia. Gerhard Schr?der made an exception recentlywhen he threatened that Germany would veto any new European directive basedon the latest proposals from the Basel committee of big-country banksupervisors. In its present form, said Mr Schr?der in Bangalore, Basel 2 (asthe proposals are known) is ""unacceptable to Germany"".Basel 2 attempts to formulate more precisely than before the levels of""regulatory"" capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the creditand other risks that they run. After more than three years of talks, theBasel boffins have developed rules which are still not acceptable tocommercial banks. That is strange, since they are supposed to mirror the waythe world's most sophisticated banks themselves calculate their risks. Thewhole exercise has shades of Heath Robinson about it.The banks are up in arms, this week bearding the Basel committee for itslatest draft rules, which get ever more complicated and prescriptive. By thetime they are implemented, in 2005 at the earliest, the rules look likely toburden banks with extra costs (ie, through the need to run parallelreporting systems) and perverse incentives to ""game"" the system. Basel 2could thus aggravate the very thing it set out to correct, a distortion offinancial markets.Germany's grouse has to do with the Mittelstand, the 3m small andmedium-sized companies that are the economy's backbone. The Basel 2 formulaefor credit risk are based on credit ratings applied to company debt, eitherby rating agencies or internally by banks themselves. But few smallercompanies are rated in this way. Moreover, German companies are more thanusually dependent on medium-term bank loans, and the longer the loan themore it is penalised under the proposals. The Germans-but also the Italians and the Japanese-fear that theirmedium-sized companies will lose under the new capital regime. Many of the2,800 German banks are not equipped to rate the companies to which theylend: equipping them would drive up the cost of lending. German bankassociations plan to help by pooling credit data for their members. But MrSchr?der's advice to banks last week was that they should not be overhastyin applying the new Basel principles ahead of time.Already the committee is working on a fix. On November 5th it posted aclutch of new suggestions on its website that included new risk weightingsfor smaller companies, and proposals that physical collateral, receivablesand even leased assets be used to lessen a particular company's creditcharge. These were interim ideas, it said, which needed to be tested andeven revised.All well and good. But the Basel committee is getting into knots trying toaddress every objection as it arises. Each time, it seems, the committeeadds another layer of complexity for banks and their supervisors to master.Most recently, after strident objections by banks, there was the shifting ofthe ""w-factor"" (the possibly unquantifiable residual risk in a creditderivative) from one supervisory category to another, and also the settingof arbitrary minimum risk weights for unrated securitised assets. The figurefor operational risk (non-market risks such as the loss of data, a roguetrader or the destruction of a bank's headquarters) has been slashed, afterobjections from banks.The November 5th pabulum came in response to a ""quantitative impact study""(a live study of how the proposed capital charges would affect a sample of138 banks in 25 countries). The Basel committee has always said that thescale of charges needs to be properly calibrated. In fact, it gave itself anextra year to get the calibration right. It has invited some banks to takepart in a fresh impact study using its latest proposed adjustments.The results should help the Basel committee to tweak its formulae to getresults. Its declared goal is not to increase or decrease the overallcapital charge imposed on the banking system, merely to allocate it moreefficiently.But some regulators are worried that the more risk-sensitive the regime is,the more reluctant banks will be to lend in a downturn, aggravating economiccycles. There are attempts to fix this too. For example, Spain allows itsbanks to make a provision at the inception of a loan-putting money aside fora rainy day. Some countries need to fix their accounting regimes before theycan follow suit.Regulators appear stoically optimistic that all these fixes will work, andthat a credible new framework will be established-not without flaws,perhaps, but better than what exists today. The timetable may slip, but theplan is to produce a final draft framework early next year, allowingconsultation until the end of March, which should result in a firm set ofrules by the end of 2002. That, in theory, still allows time for theEuropean Union to draft and finalise a matching directive on capitaladequacy for banks and financial firms, to be in force by January 2005.With Basel 2, bank supervisors are trying to do three main things. They wantto devise formulae that bring capital charges closer to the banks' ownmeasures of risk. They want to establish continuous review of banks'management, and especially of their risk management, as a factor inadjusting the capital charge. And they want to create incentives for greaterpublic disclosure of banks' risk exposures. This is an attempt to letmarkets take on more of a supervisory role. Yet, in reality, the supervisorsare becoming micro-managers.A member of the Basel committee insists that most of the world's 36,000banks will be governed by a regime no more complex than Basel 1, in forcetoday. The more sophisticated financial groups that aspire to a so-called""advanced"" approach will be treated differently. ""We'll be crawling all overthem initially,"" says the supervisor, ""because ultimately we're giving themmore freedom.""All the same, in between the lowest and the highest, thousands of banks willbe graduating from a standardised to a more sophisticated approach, withheavy demands on supervisors' time. Only America and Britain already have aculture of continuous review by supervisors. Most other regimes are eitherless sophisticated, or they are hamstrung by non-adjustable capital chargesthat are set at a minimum by law.Then there is the Brussels hurdle. Whatever the Basel committee decidesworks for banks must be applied in the European Union to all investmentfirms, including broker-dealers and asset managers. The scope is huge forfurther descent into mind-boggling detail. Supervisors and financial firmsmay well end up thanking Mr Schr?der if he vetoed the lot.Supervisors review cross-sectoral practiceIFR - November 10, 2001The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisationof Securities Commissions and the International Association of InsuranceSupervisors last week released, under the banner of the Joint Forum, tworeports comparing risk management practices and principles in the sectorsthey supervise.Both reports were principally aimed at the supervision of conglomerates thatincorporate businesses in banking, securities and insurance, but one alsotook a close look at risk transfer practices.The first report, Risk Management Practices and Regulatory Capital, comparedthe approaches in each sector in an effort to ""gain a better understandingof current industry practices in all three sectors"". The main sections ofthe report focus on: differences in core business activities, similaritiesand differences in risk management tools, approaches to capital regulationin the three sectors and cross-sectoral risk transfers and investments.It is in relation to the latter two sections that the report provided whatsome may regard as its sting. The Joint Forum suggested that as supervisorsevaluate the extent of cross-sectoral activity, in terms of risk transferusing derivatives, securitisation and other techniques: ""It may becomeimportant for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to betterreflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to thoseframeworks. It would not be surprising, for example, for some jurisdictionsin the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks appliedto the different sectors.""The report explained that supervisors should consider the potential forexisting capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage.""To the extent that some firms are engaging in activities that are notaddressed through capital requirements, supervisors need to ensure thatother measures are in place to ensure that the associated risks are beingappropriately managed and are supported by sufficient economic capital,"" itadded.As a result, the report said, supervisors should continue to evaluateapproaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments withinthe various capital frameworks.  The second report, Core Principles,compared the core principles each supervisor has issued to its respectivesector as risk management guidelines.The Joint Forum found that each set of core principles provided an overviewof the essential elements of the supervisory regime in that sector at thetime they were written (1997-2000).  However, the pace of developments inthe financial sector since then has required consideration of the need tokeep the core principles updated.

ISDA's new supplement includes converts in default swaps
Dow Jones - November 12, 2001
By Joe Niedzielski

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The International Swaps and Derivatives Association
has published a supplement to its 1999 document for credit derivatives which
incorporates convertible bonds and zero-coupon bonds, among others, as
deliverable securities in these contracts. 

The trade group said late Friday that it had finalized and published its
Supplement Relating to Convertible, Exchangeable or Accreting Obligations.

The supplement addresses the treatment under the 1999 ISDA Credit
Derivatives Definition of certain types of convertible and exchangeable
obligations, as well as the treatment of accreting obligations, such as
zero-coupon bonds, low coupon bonds issued at a discount and non-discounted
bonds that accrete during their term, ISDA said. 

""The Convertibles Supplement represents the consensus of a diverse range of
constituents in the credit derivatives markets, including portfolio
managers, credit protection sellers and dealers,"" said Robert G. Pickel,
ISDA's executive director and CEO. 

Credit default swaps allow buyers to transfer the risk of a default on
obligations like bonds or loans, or other types of credit events like a debt
restructuring. They have had a growing influence in the broader fixed-income
universe, at times playing a role in the pricing of corporate bonds. 

And some convertible-bond investors will lay off the credit risk from the
fixed-income portion of a convertible security by buying credit default swap
protection. 

ISDA's supplement was expected. A group of U.S.-based dealers submitted a
proposal to ISDA a few months ago to include obligations like convertible
bonds as deliverable securities in these contracts. 

And in mid-October, ISDA told members that convertible bonds were
deliverable under standard credit derivatives contracts. The group's
memorandum to members came in response to questions from members following
the appointment of a railway administrator for Railtrack PLC (U.RTK). 

Holders of convertible bonds issued by Railtrack had complained that some
sellers of credit protection weren't paying claims on default swap contracts
on the Railtrack credit. 


The Basel perplex
The Economist - November 8, 2001

The arcane world of banking supervision is not usually the talk of German
chancellors on tours of Asia. Gerhard Schr?der made an exception recently
when he threatened that Germany would veto any new European directive based
on the latest proposals from the Basel committee of big-country bank
supervisors. In its present form, said Mr Schr?der in Bangalore, Basel 2 (as
the proposals are known) is ""unacceptable to Germany"".

Basel 2 attempts to formulate more precisely than before the levels of
""regulatory"" capital that banks must hold as a cushion against the credit
and other risks that they run. After more than three years of talks, the
Basel boffins have developed rules which are still not acceptable to
commercial banks. That is strange, since they are supposed to mirror the way
the world's most sophisticated banks themselves calculate their risks. The
whole exercise has shades of Heath Robinson about it.

Supervisors review cross-sectoral practice
IFR - November 10, 2001

The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, the International Organisation
of Securities Commissions and the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors last week released, under the banner of the Joint Forum, two
reports comparing risk management practices and principles in the sectors
they supervise.

Both reports were principally aimed at the supervision of conglomerates that
incorporate businesses in banking, securities and insurance, but one also
took a close look at risk transfer practices.

The first report, Risk Management Practices and Regulatory Capital, compared
the approaches in each sector in an effort to ""gain a better understanding
of current industry practices in all three sectors"". The main sections of
the report focus on: differences in core business activities, similarities
and differences in risk management tools, approaches to capital regulation
in the three sectors and cross-sectoral risk transfers and investments.

It is in relation to the latter two sections that the report provided what
some may regard as its sting. The Joint Forum suggested that as supervisors
evaluate the extent of cross-sectoral activity, in terms of risk transfer
using derivatives, securitisation and other techniques: ""It may become
important for the individual sectoral frameworks to be updated to better
reflect the contemporary risk profiles of the firms subject to those
frameworks. It would not be surprising, for example, for some jurisdictions
in the near future to consider greater convergence in the frameworks applied
to the different sectors.""

The report explained that supervisors should consider the potential for
existing capital regulations to provide incentives for capital arbitrage.
""To the extent that some firms are engaging in activities that are not
addressed through capital requirements, supervisors need to ensure that
other measures are in place to ensure that the associated risks are being
appropriately managed and are supported by sufficient economic capital,"" it
added.

As a result, the report said, supervisors should continue to evaluate
approaches that could be taken to address crosssectoral investments within
the various capital frameworks.  The second report, Core Principles,
compared the core principles each supervisor has issued to its respective
sector as risk management guidelines.

The Joint Forum found that each set of core principles provided an overview
of the essential elements of the supervisory regime in that sector at the
time they were written (1997-2000).  However, the pace of developments in
the financial sector since then has required consideration of the need to
keep the core principles updated.  The report found no evidence of
underlying conflict or contradiction between the three sets of core
principles at the highest levels. However, in some cases there are
significant differences in the application of similar principles.

This morning, I spoke with Ms. Giltrop.  In light of our policy of only providing neutral references and other liability considerations, I stated that I did not believe we would provide MD Anderson a list of employees who were laid off, but that I would try to find an approved vehicle for getting information regarding job openings at MD Anderson to our former employees.  The MD Anderson web site does not reflect all current open positions, so I suggested that, if approved on both ends, MD Anderson could provide a list of openings with job descriptions that could be made available to former Enron employees.  Ms. Giltrop is attempting to obtain appropriate approval from MD Anderson.  She later phoned to inform me that I should expect to hear more from Deborah Manning, Jim Dorn, or Martha Jones.  

On our end, I have contacted David Oxley who put me in touch with Cindy Olson.  Sarah Davis will now handle coordinating relations with MD Anderson.  This is an important opportunity for former employees, and for Enron and MD Anderson as good Houston citizens.  Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

I have yet another request for which I need your input.  Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).  What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.  For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.  It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).  I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e. admins, clerks, etc.  If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.The data needs to be as recent as possible.  Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.  If you have more recent data, that would be great.  At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)  It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.  Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal.

  John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of ""Compressor Fuel"" consumed in a ""continuing business activity"" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,

Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

Subject:	RE: Transwestern pipeline Colorado Audit FEIN 74-1294795 (Account	 L80-30571) Tour, Status and Protest  (COMPRESSOR FUEL)

John, I have prepared a more formal position regarding the exemption of ""Compressor Fuel"" consumed in a ""continuing business activity"" (Gas services).  Before I submit this position to you, I will circulate my position letter within the company and validate the facts.  
I will be relying primarily on Colorado Regulations 26-102.21 or 39-26-104.1(d.1).  Have these regulations changed recently?  My service may be out of date.
Attached below are schedules for Compressor and Domestic fuel consumption for the audit period.

Dan,
Here is my initial response.  I haven't had time to do too much research on
this, but this preliminarily the Department's position.  Sorry this took so
long  but I am working on a bankruptcy case which has my first priority.  jp

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing
accompanying the transfer of cash from Enron to Northwest Pipeline Corp., I
might agree.  But, the purchase agreement lists assets acquired for cash.

I don't believe that the statute and regulation support that position.
Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

> PENALTY & INTEREST

> I will be requesting a waiver of penalty and interest on any assessment.

The disposition of penalty and interest will be resolved at a level above the auditor level.

New startup proposes global virtual services

Marlene Tissot

12 November 2001=20

A project to build a global network for multimedia services, based entirely=

 on switched virtual circuits (SVCs), has been revealed to CWI. And it inte=

nds to prove the value of connectionless network services for customers by =

carrying output from the Olympic Games in Beijing around the world. While n=

ew carriers are counting their cash and hoping to hold the fort until the m=

arket turns around, SynerG Communications Ltd., believes it can prove to ev=

 even in these harsh times. Backed by an Asian media mogul that prefers to =

keep a low profile, as well as an equipment vendor and a network operator i=

n the United States, its founders claim SynerG already has verbal commitmen=

ts from customers amounting to $100 million in revenues. And they say they =

are negotiating to gain rights to carry multimedia content from the Beijing=

 Olympics in 2008. SynerG's business plan is based on a relatively uncommon=

 way to deliver bandwidth. Ken Rice, the chairman and founder of California=

-based International SynerG Communications Holdings Ltd., says that potenti=

al cost savings for end-users will be compelling because they will be able =

to provision bandwidth on an ad hoc basis, giving them so-called bandwidth =

on demand. A 41-node global ATM-based switched virtual circuit network will=

actually use, according to Rice, who claims his project is significantly di=

If the operating agreement constituted the entirety of the writing

Transporting gas would have to qualify as providing gas or electric service
to qualify for the exemption.  I don't believe it does.  I definitely need
more research on this.

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

Second, Seminole is a public util=ity and outside of the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commissio=n, which presumably made it easier for Calpine to gain access into the stat=e. Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative headquart=ered in Tampa, Fla. It provides bulk supplies of electricity and wholesale =energy services to 10 cooperatives located throughout peninsular Florida. A=s of December 2000, more than 1.5 million business and residential consumer=s in 45 counties received electric service from Seminole and its members. A=ccording to information from Seminole, the bulk of its generating reserves =is provided through a 20-year agreement with Calpine, which runs through 20=13. Additional terms of the contract were not disclosed.=20The Osprey facility will be located next to Calpine's existing 150-MW cogen=eration facility in Auburndale, Fla., where a new 115-MW simple-cycle peaki=ng unit is also under construction and expected to come online next year. R=egarding the planned 1,080-MW plant near Vero Beach, Fla. Calpine reportedl=y has found buyers for about one-half of the power it would produce from th=e plant, enough to obtain the necessary state permits. This plant could be =under construction by the end of next year. Calpine also opened a Tampa off=ice in 2000 to support its expansion in Florida and the Southeast, which in=dicates that the company intends to remain a major player in this region, w=hich has been comparatively slow to embrace electric deregulation.=20Further, Calpine participates in a group known as the Florida Partnership f=or Affordable Competitive Electricity (Florida PACE), which has attempted t=o persuade lawmakers in the state, including Gov. Jeb Bush, to deregulate F=lorida's wholesale market. One measure that would help to give the state a =competitive kick start, or so says the group, would be to allow companies t=o build new power plants and resell the electricity to retail power sellers= such as Florida Power & Light. A final report from the Florida Energy 2020= commission, which should address some of these issues, is expected Dec. 1.==20Ironically, public resistance to new power plants in Florida comes at a tim=e when new reports suggest that the state faces an imminent power supply pr=oblem. According to representatives from the state's Energy 2020 Study Comm=ission, Florida's electric reserve is significantly less than the 16-percen=t reserve that incumbent utilities have claimed exists. In fact, the commis=sion has found that, ""without extraordinary management techniques including= power disruption,"" Florida's reserve is 7 percent. It is important to note= that the commission is not including interruptible loads in its reserve ca=lculations. If interruptible load is considered, then Florida most likely d=oes have a roughly 16-percent electric reserve. Thus, Florida's policy of r=equiring out-of-state generators to sign long-term contracts with incumbent= retailers could be considered a very prudent move, as any new generation t=hat gets developed in the state is committed to a retail provider (reducing= the possibility that power could be withheld to drive up market prices).==20As a whole, Calpine has a generation arsenal that includes some 37,700-MW b=aseload capacity of mostly natural gas-fired and renewable geothermal resou=rces. In addition to the baseload generation, Calpine also owns or controls= about 8,000 MW of peaking capacity that is presently in operation. Peaking= units generally operate in times of especially high demand when normal sup=plies are strained.=20As the leading builder of power plants in North America, Calpine is one of =a small number of generating companies that have banked on a steady increas=e in demand across the United States, along with the need to supply power d=uring periods of peak demand. Other companies competing against Calpine in =this space include Reliant Energy, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy, which coll=ectively have reportedly announced plans to build some 422,000 MW of genera=ting capacity over the next 13 years. Calpine specifically has acknowledged= that it will buy 27 steam engines from Siemens AG between 2002 and 2005 to= build 5,400 MW of generating capacity.=20Many of these plans for new generating facilities were outlined over the la=st year or two, when the United States faced a well-publicized energy crunc=h. Now, the pendulum has swung back to leave many of the same companies wor=ried about a possible energy glut in which they will have excess power that= cannot be sold (or sold at lower-than-anticipated prices). Certainly, a la=rge portion of the generation planned while supply was compromised and pric=es were high will be canceled or delayed. However, as one example, Calpine =appears to be following through with an aggressive generation expansion str=ategy. One approach that might help Calpine to beat the odds against an ene=rgy glut is that the company continues to build generation in markets that =are projected to have continually increasing demand. However, from a broad =perspective, Calpine may find that, as other companies continue with plans =for generation facilities that may have progressed too far to be terminated=, the surplus of supply could have an impact on prices, which could in turn= impact the market as a whole.=20An archive list of previous IssueAlert articles is available atwww.scientech.com <http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/>=20  _____ =20We encourage our readers to contact us with their comments.

Calpine Corp. Becomes One of the Few Companies to Penetrate Florida's Whole=

Director, Electric Industry Analysis





[News item from Reuters] San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine Corp. (NYSE: CPN) a=

nnounced that it has begun construction of its planned 530-MW Osprey power =

plant in Auburndale, Fla. The plant, known as the Osprey Energy Center, is =

expected to begin commercial operation in late 2003, according to company s=

tatements. Calpine said in June that it had received Florida's regulatory a=

pproval for the plant, and that it was expected to cost $250 million to bui=

ld. Calpine also said that it is ""continuing to move forward"" with the prop=

osed 1,080-MW Blue Heron Energy Center, slated for Indian River County, Fla=

.=20



Analysis: With the onset of construction on this plant, Calpine now reporte=

dly ranks as one of the few out-of-state generating companies that has been=

 able to penetrate Florida's wholesale power market. Other companies such a=

s Enron have made similar attempts to begin construction on new plants (or =

gain control over existing plants), only to be blocked by community and reg=

ulatory resistance. Calpine, which now ranks as the largest builder of powe=

r plants in North America, has gained entry into Florida by agreeing to sel=

l the output from the plant to one of Florida's existing utilities. Neverth=

eless, it is a concession that supports Calpine's larger strategy for expan=

sion, both within Florida and across the United States. Along with the Ospr=

ey and Blue Heron facilities, Calpine also plans to eventually build a 1,08=

0-MW, $500-million plant near Vero Beach, Fla., which certainly positions t=

he company as the leading out-of-state generator in Florida's rather cloist=

ered wholesale market.=20



It is important to note that the Osprey Energy Center, which will be a comb=

ined-cycle, natural gas-fired facility, will be the first power plant of it=

s kind to be built by an independent power producer (IPP) in Florida under =

the state's stringent Power Plant Siting Act. There are some fundamental as=

pects of Florida's $13-billion electric market that should be established f=

or context. First, Florida represents the third-largest electric market in =

the United States in terms of consumption (193 million megawatt-hours, acco=

rding to the Energy Information Administration), so deregulation of the sta=

te remains of great importance to many stakeholders. However, Florida has t=

aken a ""go slow"" approach toward electric competition and, at this point, t=

here is no plan to initiate retail competition in Florida. Leaders of the s=

tate (including Gov. Jeb Bush) have supported competition in the state's wh=

olesale market in an effort to move cautiously toward total deregulation. F=

lorida's Energy 2020 Study Commission, which is preparing the blueprint for=

 competition in the state, endorsed a plan to allow out-of-state companies =

to enter Florida's wholesale market by building new plants and selling powe=

r to the state's incumbent utilities.=20



However, the Florida Supreme Court has banned out-of-state companies from b=

uilding merchant plants in the state, which would be free to sell power any=

where and are not subject to rate regulation by the state's regulatory comm=

ission. A good example of this is Enron, which has attempted several times =

to build new generation facilities in the state. A proposed plant in Pompan=

o Beach, Fla., was rejected amid strong community resistance. Enron was giv=

en governmental approval to proceed with a peaking unit in Deerfield Beach,=

 Fla., for which the company is still attempting to obtain air quality perm=

its. According to Enron, the Deerfield Beach plant was approved because it =

was classified as a peaking unit, and will be allowed to generate only duri=

ng times of peak demand. It is not known at this time if Enron will continu=

e with its plans to build this plant now that it is being acquired by Dyneg=

y Inc. Southern Company has also moved into Florida (its first expansion ou=

tside of its service area) after receiving preliminary approval to build a =

633-MW natural-gas generation facility in Orlando. Southern Company has agr=

eed to sell the total output from this plant in a 10-year contract with the=

 Orlando Utilities Commission, Kissimmee Utility Authority and Florida Muni=

cipal Power Agency.=20



Nevertheless, the important point is that Florida has been a notoriously di=

fficult state for outside generating companies to enter and obtain permissi=

on to build new generating facilities. Florida law does allow out-of-state =

companies to build peaker plants, as long as they only operate in times of =

especially high demand when normal supplies are strained. Some new plants a=

re small enough as to not need approval from the Florida Public Service Com=

mission, although they still must obtain approval related to zoning laws an=

d air pollution permits. One proposal under the 2020 plan has suggested eli=

minating the involvement of the governor and the State Cabinet in approving=

 proposed plants, and limiting the ability of local governments to block pr=

ojects.=20



There are two factors that enabled Calpine to gain approval to proceed with=

 the Osprey plant. First, Calpine seemingly has signed a long-term contract=

 to sell the output of the plant to Seminole Electric Cooperative under a l=

ong-term contract, which meets the Supreme Court standard that out-of-state=

 generators cannot build merchant plants. Second, Seminole is a public util=

ity and outside of the jurisdiction of the Florida Public Service Commissio=

n, which presumably made it easier for Calpine to gain access into the stat=

e. Seminole Electric is a generation and transmission cooperative headquart=

ered in Tampa, Fla. It provides bulk supplies of electricity and wholesale =

energy services to 10 cooperatives located throughout peninsular Florida. A=

s of December 2000, more than 1.5 million business and residential consumer=

s in 45 counties received electric service from Seminole and its members. A=

ccording to information from Seminole, the bulk of its generating reserves =

is provided through a 20-year agreement with Calpine, which runs through 20=

13. Additional terms of the contract were not disclosed.=20



The Osprey facility will be located next to Calpine's existing 150-MW cogen=

eration facility in Auburndale, Fla., where a new 115-MW simple-cycle peaki=

ng unit is also under construction and expected to come online next year. R=

egarding the planned 1,080-MW plant near Vero Beach, Fla. Calpine reportedl=

y has found buyers for about one-half of the power it would produce from th=

e plant, enough to obtain the necessary state permits. This plant could be =

under construction by the end of next year. Calpine also opened a Tampa off=

ice in 2000 to support its expansion in Florida and the Southeast, which in=

dicates that the company intends to remain a major player in this region, w=

hich has been comparatively slow to embrace electric deregulation.=20



Further, Calpine participates in a group known as the Florida Partnership f=

or Affordable Competitive Electricity (Florida PACE), which has attempted t=

o persuade lawmakers in the state, including Gov. Jeb Bush, to deregulate F=

lorida's wholesale market. One measure that would help to give the state a =

competitive kick start, or so says the group, would be to allow companies t=

o build new power plants and resell the electricity to retail power sellers=

 such as Florida Power & Light. A final report from the Florida Energy 2020=

 commission, which should address some of these issues, is expected Dec. 1.=

=20



Ironically, public resistance to new power plants in Florida comes at a tim=

e when new reports suggest that the state faces an imminent power supply pr=

oblem. According to representatives from the state's Energy 2020 Study Comm=

ission, Florida's electric reserve is significantly less than the 16-percen=

t reserve that incumbent utilities have claimed exists. In fact, the commis=

sion has found that, ""without extraordinary management techniques including=

 power disruption,"" Florida's reserve is 7 percent. It is important to note=

 that the commission is not including interruptible loads in its reserve ca=

lculations. If interruptible load is considered, then Florida most likely d=

oes have a roughly 16-percent electric reserve. Thus, Florida's policy of r=

equiring out-of-state generators to sign long-term contracts with incumbent=

 retailers could be considered a very prudent move, as any new generation t=

hat gets developed in the state is committed to a retail provider (reducing=

 the possibility that power could be withheld to drive up market prices).=

=20



As a whole, Calpine has a generation arsenal that includes some 37,700-MW b=

aseload capacity of mostly natural gas-fired and renewable geothermal resou=

rces. In addition to the baseload generation, Calpine also owns or controls=

 about 8,000 MW of peaking capacity that is presently in operation. Peaking=

 units generally operate in times of especially high demand when normal sup=

plies are strained.=20



As the leading builder of power plants in North America, Calpine is one of =

a small number of generating companies that have banked on a steady increas=

e in demand across the United States, along with the need to supply power d=

uring periods of peak demand. Other companies competing against Calpine in =

this space include Reliant Energy, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy, which coll=

ectively have reportedly announced plans to build some 422,000 MW of genera=

ting capacity over the next 13 years. Calpine specifically has acknowledged=

 that it will buy 27 steam engines from Siemens AG between 2002 and 2005 to=

 build 5,400 MW of generating capacity.=20



Many of these plans for new generating facilities were outlined over the la=

st year or two, when the United States faced a well-publicized energy crunc=

h. Now, the pendulum has swung back to leave many of the same companies wor=

ried about a possible energy glut in which they will have excess power that=

 cannot be sold (or sold at lower-than-anticipated prices). Certainly, a la=

rge portion of the generation planned while supply was compromised and pric=

es were high will be canceled or delayed. However, as one example, Calpine =

appears to be following through with an aggressive generation expansion str=

ategy. One approach that might help Calpine to beat the odds against an ene=

rgy glut is that the company continues to build generation in markets that =

are projected to have continually increasing demand. However, from a broad =

perspective, Calpine may find that, as other companies continue with plans =

for generation facilities that may have progressed too far to be terminated=

, the surplus of supply could have an impact on prices, which could in turn=

 impact the market as a whole.=20

Byrne It's hard to think of a CEO that commands as much respect as Jack Welch. Under his leadership, General Electric reinvented itself several times over by integrating new and innovative practices, including Six Sigma and the Internet, into its many lines of business. In Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_47>, Welch, with the help of John Byrne, talks about his career and the style of management that helped to make GE one of the most successful companies of the last century.

In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and ""dangerous"" way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view. Locke, who was a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=mk_del_235668_59>, has been a longtime customer of Amazon.com.

Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why ""values"" are taking center stage in today's marketplace.    <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/orange-arrow.gif>Read more <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_65> Our Price: $19.25    You Save: $8.25 (30%)         <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281777/ref=mk_del_235668_67> 	Toward Rational Exuberance: The Evolution of the Modern Stock Market <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374281777/ref=mk_del_235668_68>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>by B.

Koehn In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.   <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/orange-arrow.gif>Read more <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578512212/ref=mk_del_235668_73> Our Price: $27.96    You Save: $11.99 (30%)        More Business & Investing Editors' PicksThe Essential Drucker <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066210879/ref=mk_del_235668_75>The Agenda <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609609661/ref=mk_del_235668_76>The Attention Economy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/157851441X/ref=mk_del_235668_77>Breaking Windows <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743203151/ref=mk_del_235668_78>Now, Discover Your Strengths <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743201140/ref=mk_del_235668_79>Basic Economics: A Citizen's Guide to the Economy <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/046508138X/ref=mk_del_235668_80>  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/orange-arrow.gif>See all Business & Investing Editors' Picks <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/221638/ref=mk_del_235668_81>   <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>Best Books of 2001: Customers' Picks 	  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/horizi.gif>  <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/delivers/shadow.gif><http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0399144463/ref=mk_del_235668_821773040>Check out our list of bestselling business and investing books of 2001.

<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_401773040>Hundreds of business and investing books have crossed my desk this year. Below is a list of my favorites. Of these, Jim Collins's Good to Great <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620996/ref=mk_del_235668_41> is my pick for best business book of the year. The work is the result of five years of research into companies that have delivered extraordinary long-term results. You'll be surprised at not only the companies Collins tags as great, but at the approach they took to achieve their results.

by Jack Welch, John A. Byrne 
It's hard to think of a CEO that commands as much respect as Jack Welch.

Jack: Straight from the Gut <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446528382/ref=mk_del_235668_48> promises to be the most sought-after business book of the year, so don't miss out--order your copy today.

Gonzo Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_57>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Christopher Locke 
Count on Chris Locke to poke holes in the conventional thinking that determines how companies relate to their markets. In Gonzo Marketing <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204080/ref=mk_del_235668_58>, Locke takes on the mass-market mindset that defines most big companies and prescribes a new and ""dangerous"" way for businesses to interact with customers. Smart and provocative, this book belongs on the shelf of any businessperson looking for a fresh point of view. Locke, who was a coauthor of The Cluetrain Manifesto <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315/ref=mk_del_235668_59>, has been a longtime customer of Amazon.com. His personal page <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/cm/member-reviews/-/AH9RPJBDYJQFB/ref=mk_del_235668_60> at Amazon.com is worth a look.

The Myth of Excellence: Why Great Companies Never Try to Be the Best at Everything <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0609608207/ref=mk_del_235668_64>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Fred Crawford, Ryan Mathews 
The first thing Fred Crawford and Ryan Mathews asked themselves after surveying 5,000 consumers was how their survey respondents could be so wrong. Their results so upset the conventional thinking about consumer marketing that the two began to reevaluate their assumptions about what American consumers really want--and the results will probably surprise you as well. In The Myth of Excellence, Crawford and Mathews show why ""values"" are taking center stage in today's marketplace.

Brand New : How Entrepreneurs Earned Consumers' Trust from Wedgwood to Dell <http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578512212/ref=mk_del_235668_72>     Icon <http://g-images.amazon.com/images/G/01/icons/icon-books.gif>
by Nancy F. Koehn 
In Brand New, Harvard Business School Professor Nancy Koehn looks at six extraordinary brands and the entrepreneurs that built them, from Josiah Wedgwood and Henry Heinz to Howard Schultz and Michael Dell. What interests Koehn is not so much the success these brands enjoyed as much as the trust these household names were able to inspire in consumers. Part business history, part marketing manual, Brand New is a revealing study of brand development that belongs on every thoughtful marketer's bookshelf.

Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity =factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity= factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the= value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op=erate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes= that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy tr=ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p=rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they= are not needed to meet higher demands for power.=20The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of bas=eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conect=iv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications busi=ness (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for =$20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co=-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-ut=ility electric generator, for $9 million.=20Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own=ership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region.= The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r=epay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. C=onectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power =generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conecti=v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon=ey to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S=tation, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur=al gas.=20The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge=neration supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses=, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units =only) and a regulated delivery business.

Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Unit=s 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Ent=ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat=ion to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt=., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Enterg=y will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the Ne=w York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Niag=ara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear =for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and =82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 mill=ion, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently i=ncreased its nuclear power assets.=20Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate=d with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether o=r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence. Exelon, for example, is =involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucle=ar technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). Supporters of PBMR =believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short construction =time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power an =acceptable option. In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with th=e U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United= States.

[News item from PR Newswire] Conectiv (NYSE: CIV), an energy provider locat=

ed in the Mid-Atlantic, announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Atlanti=

c City Electric Company, completed the sale of its ownership interests in t=

hree nuclear plants to PSEG Nuclear LLC and Exelon Generation Company. The =

ownership interests were sold for approximately $11.3 million, excluding re=

imbursement of estimated fuel inventory, subject to adjustment.=20



Analysis: This announcement from Conectiv came out late last week, but I di=

d not want to miss the opportunity to provide some analytical commentary on=

 what I think is a rather significant development. The transfer of ownershi=

p in the three nuclear plants included in this transaction is significant b=

ecause of its relation to Conectiv's unique competitive strategy and the ro=

und-robin way in which nuclear assets are changing hands in the United Stat=

es. Further, despite an increase in acquisition activity around the nation'=

s nuclear facilities, we still are seeing only a small number of companies =

that actually own or control nuclear power in the United States.=20



The divestiture of the nuclear assets includes only what is Conectiv's owne=

rship in the plants, which Conectiv shares with other companies (who also h=

appen to be the buying partners in this sale). The breakdown of the sale of=

 nuclear assets is as follows:=20



A 7.51-percent interest (164 MW) in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station U=

nits 2 and 3 sold in equal shares to co-owners PSEG Nuclear and Exelon. Pri=

or to the transaction, PSEG Nuclear, an indirect subsidiary of Public Servi=

ce Enterprise Group Incorporated, and Exelon each owned about 46 percent of=

 the Peach Bottom plant. Exelon is the operator of the Peach Bottom facilit=

y.=20





A 7.41-percent interest (167 MW) in the Salem Nuclear Generation Station Un=

its 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which prior to the sale owned about 5=

0 percent of the facility. PSEG Nuclear will remain the operator of the pla=

nt.=20





A 5-percent interest (52 MW) in the Hope Creek Nuclear Generation Station U=

nits 1 and 2 was sold to PSEG Nuclear, which is the operator of the plant a=

nd prior to the sale owned 95 percent of the facility.=20







As noted, the significance of these transactions relates to Conectiv's comp=

etitive strategy and the consolidation that is taking place in the nuclear =

sector. Let's look at Conectiv first.=20



According to Conectiv's President and COO Thomas Shaw, the divestiture of t=

he nuclear assets is consistent with the company's focused business strateg=

y on two core energy businesses: Conectiv Energy, the company's integrated =

generation and asset optimization group, and Conectiv Power Delivery, the c=

ompany's regulated delivery business. To support this two-tiered focus, Con=

ectiv has been in the process of divesting its baseload generating plants t=

o expand a generation portfolio that includes only mid-merit plants (units =

that have more flexibility to follow demand patterns). Mid-merit plants are=

 often viewed as units that fill the operating space between baseload plant=

s and peaker units. Whereas a baseload unit may have a generating capacity =

factor of about 80 percent, a mid-merit unit may have a generating capacity=

 factor of about 30 percent to 55 percent. From Conectiv's perspective, the=

 value of the mid-merit strategy is that these plants can be reserved to op=

erate only when demand is comparatively high. Further, the company believes=

 that mid-merit units are ideally suited to support the company's energy tr=

ading and asset optimization strategy because they are flexible enough to p=

rovide fuel arbitrage opportunities and ancillary service support when they=

 are not needed to meet higher demands for power.=20



The sale of the nuclear assets follows the previous sale of 1,081 MW of bas=

eload generating capacity by Delmarva Power & Light, a subsidiary of Conect=

iv, to NRG Energy and the divestiture of Conectiv's telecommunications busi=

ness (Conectiv Communications) to Cavalier Telephone of Richmond, Va., for =

$20 million. In addition, Conectiv sold its 50-percent stake in a 118-MW co=

-generation facility in New Jersey to Pedricktown Cogeneration LP, a non-ut=

ility electric generator, for $9 million.=20



Conectiv is divesting all of its baseload generation but has maintained own=

ership of some 2,000 MW of mid-merit generation in the Mid-Atlantic region.=

 The proceeds from the coal plant sales to NRG will reportedly be used to r=

epay debt and fund Conectiv's development of additional mid-merit assets. C=

onectiv's immediate goal is to build more than 4,000 MW of mid-merit power =

generation within the Mid-Atlantic region by 2004. Toward that end, Conecti=

v is taking some of the proceeds from the NRG transaction and using the mon=

ey to support a $300-million, 500-MW expansion of its Hay Road Generating S=

tation, which is currently a 516-MW plant that is primarily fueled by natur=

al gas.=20



The divestiture of both the telecommunications business and the baseload ge=

neration supports Conectiv's strategy of re-focusing on its core businesses=

, which are power trading and wholesale marketing (through mid-merit units =

only) and a regulated delivery business. Conectiv Power Delivery provides e=

nergy service to more than one million customers in New Jersey, Delaware, M=

aryland, and Virginia. Given the fairly distinct line between Conectiv's re=

gulated and unregulated businesses, I have previously speculated that Conec=

tiv could be preparing to spin off its unregulated businesses into a stand-=

alone company (a trend represented by AEP, Reliant and UtiliCorp). Conectiv=

 is in the midst of major restructuring, so it is unlikely that any such sp=

in off of its generation business would take place in the near term. Howeve=

r, as far as I know, Conectiv is the only energy company that has focused e=

xclusively on mid-merit plants.=20



Conectiv is also involved in merger proceedings with Pepco, a partnership t=

hat is scheduled to close in April 2002. In this deal, Pepco is acquiring C=

onectiv for a combination of cash and stock valued at $2.2 billion. Both co=

mpanies will become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be named at a =

later date. The partnership between these two relatively small and regional=

ly based utility companies reportedly will create the largest electricity d=

elivery company in the Mid-Atlantic region. By combining their two electric=

ity delivery businesses, Pepco and Conectiv reportedly will more than doubl=

e their customer base and expand their service territory by nine times.=20



In the nuclear sector, it is not terribly surprising that Exelon and PSEG N=

uclear would be the buying partners in the three nuclear plants sold by Con=

ectiv (despite the obvious fact that these companies already maintained maj=

ority ownership in the plants). Exelon and PSEG Nuclear are two of what is =

a small number of companies that are actively involved in the nuclear-power=

 space, and thus it is not surprising that they would be involved in the li=

cense exchange on these three plants. Exelon has the largest nuclear fleet =

in the nation and still outpaces most of the competition in the nuclear ind=

ustry, owning a total of 17 reactors. Earlier this year, Exelon CEO Corbin =

McNeill said he thought that a new nuclear plant would definitely be built =

in the next five years, and did not rule out the fact that his company migh=

t be the one to drive the construction of the new nuclear facility.=20



As noted, PSEG Nuclear is an indirect subsidiary of the Public Service Ente=

rprise Group Inc., which in 2000 was split into PSE&G, a regulated gas and =

electric delivery company in New Jersey and PSEG Power, an unregulated U.S.=

 power generation company. As noted, PSEG Nuclear LLC operates the Salem an=

d Hope Creek Nuclear Generating Stations in Lower Alloways Creek, N.J., and=

 oversees PSEG Power's ownership interest in the Peach Bottom Atomic Power =

Station, located in Delta, Pa. When the Conectiv transaction is completed, =

PSEG Power will own 100 percent of Hope Creek, 52 percent of Salem, and 50 =

percent of Peach Bottom.=20



In addition to Exelon and PSEG Nuclear, Entergy Corp. is another company th=

at deserves a mention when discussing the nuclear sector. Since 1999, Enter=

gy has been an active bidder on most every nuclear plant that has come onto=

 the auction block. Recently, Entergy bought Con Edison's Indian Point Unit=

s 1 and 2 nuclear power plants in Westchester County, N.Y. In addition, Ent=

ergy recently announced an agreement with the Vermont Yankee Power Corporat=

ion to purchase the 501-MW Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon, Vt=

., for $180 million. With the completion of the Vermont Yankee sale, Enterg=

y will own a nuclear fleet that includes 10 reactors. Also note that the Ne=

w York State Public Service Commission (PSC) just approved the sale of Niag=

ara Mohawk's Nine Mile nuclear generating station to Constellation Nuclear =

for about $780 million. The purchase prices for the 614-MW Nine Mile 1 and =

82 percent of the 1,142-MW Nine Mile 2 are about $221 million and $559 mill=

ion, respectively. Constellation is another company that has consistently i=

ncreased its nuclear power assets.=20



Given the volatility of natural gas prices and the high emissions associate=

d with coal-fired generation, many industry analysts have debated whether o=

r not nuclear power is on the brink of resurgence. Exelon, for example, is =

involved in a joint venture that is attempting to commercialize a new nucle=

ar technology called Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). Supporters of PBMR =

believe its relatively small size (110 MW), anticipated short construction =

time (24 months) and cost ($1,000/kW) can once again make nuclear power an =

acceptable option. In February of 2001, Exelon filed an application with th=

e U.S. nuclear energy regulators to license a similar reactor in the United=

 States. Clearly, steps are being taken to revive this controversial indust=

ry.=20

If Edison gets its way, all customers will pay for Edison's under-recovery from June 2000 through January 2001 plus CDWR spot market purchases during 2001.  This would take the form of a surcharge on future bills.  My concern is that Enron will be on the hook for these future charges associated with past under-collections -- even beyond the term of our legacy deals.  For example, if a deal ends in March 2002 we could be on the hook for surcharges that a legacy customer would receive on its bill after that date, provided the surcharge pertained to costs incurred by the utility during the time that the legacy customer was ours.I have not received clear guidance from legal on this matter.  For example, I asked both Mike Smith and Steve Hall to review the legacy Safeway contract which is on PGES paper.

Shortly before the teleconference Board meeting two weeks ago we received

consideration has focused on the nature of the applicant's derivatives

generally admitted these applicants (e.g., the Kingdoms of Belgium, Denmark

In previous Board discussions, a higher degree of concern has been
expressed
if, theoretically, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of
England or similarly influential central banks were to apply for
membership.
These central banks typically have a greater degree of involvement in the
regulatory debates (particularly on capital) and are better positioned to
influence the process.

Since some of those previous debates, the regulatory role of the Bank of

correspondingly increased. The Bank of England still plays the traditional
central bank roles of controller of the money supply, dealing in the market
and lender of last resort, but the supervisory role has shifted to the FSA.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize therapeutic and diagnostic systems for the treatment of 
viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and reverse the progression of HIV 
infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their core technology - TNP (Thymus 
Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three human clinical trials.  Each human trial 
consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-muscular injection bi-weekly over 
an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 667 days after treatment.  The trials 
revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided after treatment and remained that way 
even 18 months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 
whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize the TNP technology.

You should be aware that an issue is currently under extensive debate in
the
credit derivative area resulting from the insolvency of Railtrack in the
UK.
ISDA has been asked by some participants in the market to make a statement
regarding a provision of its Credit Derivatives Definitions. Others are
either still considering their position or would prefer that ISDA not issue
a statement.

Specifically, the discussion relates to the deliverability of convertible
bonds of Railtrack. There is no dispute that a Credit Event occurred. What
is in dispute is whether the bonds satisfy the definition of ""Not
Contingent"" under the Definitions, which is a characteristic typically
required of deliverable obligations. This characteristic requires that the
payment or repayment of principal on the bonds not be subject to a
contingency. The bonds are convertible into equity of Railtrack at the
option of the holder or, in certain limited circumstances, at the option of
the trustee for the bondholder. The provision for the trustee to exercise
the conversion (sometimes referred to as a ""widows and orphans"" clause) is
a
standard clause in bonds issued in England and is intended to protect
bondholders who may have inadvertently failed to exercise their conversion
right when it would be clearly beneficial economically for them to do so.
In
the case of Railtrack, conversion would not have been economically
beneficial at any time recently, but nevertheless the right of the trustee
to convert exists.

A draft statement has been prepared for consideration by the Credit
Derivatives Market Practice Committee, which I have attached for your
review. The statement refers to two documents that are in draft form, the
User's Guide to the Definitions (which is scheduled to be published in the
next week or two) and a Supplement currently under consideration by the
""group of six"" subgroup of the Committee. In each of these documents, we
suggest that ""plain vanilla"" convertible bonds should satisfy the ""Not
Contingent"" characteristic and should, therefore, be deliverable. ""Plain
vanilla"" convertible bonds for this purpose include bonds where conversion
is at the option of the holder of the trustee.

A meeting of a number of dealers based in London (not an ISDA meeting) is
scheduled for Tuesday. It is not likely that we will publish anything prior
to that meeting.

I would appreciate your views on whether we should issue any statement
regarding this situation. We are continuing to poll members for their views
on whether this type of market statement would be appropriate. We are also
discussing with Allen & Overy and with Clifford Chance and Linklaters how
we
might achieve a legal basis for making the statement. Please share your

The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows(principal and interest) of the collateral assets. But CDOs are increasinglyissued in synthetic form, where there is no physical transfer of collateral.In these structures the CDO references default losses, rather than the cashflows of the referenced collateral. Credit Default Swaps In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit defaultswaps. A credit default swap is a contract where one party ,the protectionbuyer, makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on acredit event. In a single name credit default swap, the credit event is thedefault of a single issuer. Thus, the price of the credit default swapsreflects the market's view of the default likelihood of the reference name. In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap. Inthis case, in return for a premium, the protection seller makes contingentpayments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket ofassets. The protection may be for first loss or equity, in which case theseller pays for the initial default losses, up to some threshold; secondloss or mezzanine, where the seller pays losses beyond the first lossthreshold up to some higher limit; or senior, where the seller pays alllosses beyond a threshold. Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form. The simplest form ofthis structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket defaultswap. The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and atthe outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from thebond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap. As lossesoccur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to paythe required contingent payments. At the maturity of the structure theinvestor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position. In bothfunded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily amatter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves. Correlation Products It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because theirvalue depends not only on the probability of default for each individualname in the reference portfolio, but also on the correlation between thosenames. Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of twonames, each with a 5% probability of default. Assume two levels ofprotection, one paying on the first default, and one paying on the second.If the names are independent, then the probability that the first lossprotection is triggered is 1 - (0.95)2 = 9.75%, that is, 100% less thechance that there are zero defaults. The probability that the second lossprotection is triggered is (0.05)2 = 0.25%, that is, only if there are twodefaults. On the other hand, if the defaults are perfectly correlated, thenthere are only two possibilities: either both or neither of the namesdefault. Thus, the probability that either protection is triggered is theprobability that both names default, or 5%. Note that for the first lossprotection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that theprotection is invoked, and therefore reduced the fair price of thisprotection. For the second loss piece, the increased correlation hasincreased the trigger likelihood and fair price. The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for thefirst loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps. Forthe first loss piece, since losses are capped, the pricing is drivenprimarily by the likelihood that no losses occur, which increases withcorrelation. For the senior piece, the pricing is driven by the likelihoodthat an extreme loss occurs, which is greater in cases of highercorrelation. Pricing Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual defaultprobabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool. Sinceindividual default probabilities can often be obtained from single namecredit-default swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for syntheticCDOs. Consider an example structure with USD36 million of collateral, where firstloss protects against the first USD5 million of losses, second loss protectsagainst the next USD10 million of losses, and the remaining losses areprotected by the senior tranche. We can model spreads on each of thesetranches at different correlation levels. For example, using a correlationof 45%, we obtain model spreads of two basis points, 250bps and 1,642bps forthe senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively. We canrepeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain thesensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation. Figure 1 shows thenormalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlationlevels. We can see that the cost of protection for the senior trancheincreases with increasing correlation, that is the cost increases as seniordebt gets riskier, while the first loss protection cost decreases withincreasing correlation, that is the cost decreases as equity gets lessrisky. Note that, in this particular example the cost of second lossprotection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation. Implied Correlation We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices inthe same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and theBlack-Scholes pricing model. An implied correlation extracted in thisfashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model, but the observationsabove hold generally. Suppose the market spreads for our example structureare 2bps, 150bps and 2,000bps for the senior, second loss, and first lossprotection respectively. We can compare these observed spreads with ourmodel spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche. Forexample the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the seniortranche, 2bps, when we price it using a 45% correlation. In other words, theimplied correlation for the senior tranche is 45%. The implied correlationfor each tranche can be inferred from Figure 1 as the correlation level withwhich our pricing model recovers the observed market spread. We can see thatfor the first and second loss tranches, the implied correlation is roughly20%, while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is 45%. A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market asynthetic tranche on an ongoing basis. As we observe changes in the spreadsfor the individual names in the pool, we can reprice the tranches above byassuming the correlation level is constant, but updating the spreads.Additionally, implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis.For example, senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value ascorrelation increases. Since both tranches depend on the same basket ofnames, we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation. Asmentioned above, the implied correlation of the senior tranche (45%) issignificantly higher than that of the second loss tranche (20%). This meansthat senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection. Wecan also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that thepools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics, in terms of creditquality, industry, and geographical distribution. For example, if two CDOshave similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparableimplied correlations for their senior tranches. All else being equal, adiscrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of adiscrepancy in price between the two structures. CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000Risk News - October 29, 2001By Naomi HumphriesThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has released the final rulesrelating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States.These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Actof 2000 (CFMA) that lift the 19-year ban on the trading of single-stock andnarrow-based stock index futures in the US. The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regardingthe specification of listing standards and conditions for trading securityfutures products. The rules also establish requirements related to theself-certification of rules and rule amendments, reporting of data,speculative position limits, and special provisions regarding the contractdesign for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futuresproducts. The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), theChicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex)and the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG). The CFTC adopted severalrevisions consistent with comments, but stated: ""Generally, the commentatorssupported the proposed rules."" The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rulesgoverning commodity futures and options intermediaries on October 19,following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to theCommodity Exchange Act (CEA). Key rules governing intermediaries, includingfutures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operatorsand commodity trading advisers, have been revised to provide greaterflexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline andeliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act. They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access toregistered derivatives transaction execution facilities, by permitting themto trade through a commodity trading adviser with $25 million or more inassets under management, and a proposal to replace the current prescriptiverule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices. The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat, a registered futures commissionmerchant, and securities broker-dealer, Exchange Analytics, an ethicstraining provider, the CBOT, the National Futures Association and theManaged Funds Association, all generally supported the adoption of theproposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries.

Pricing Synthetic CDO's
Derivatives Week - October 29, 2001

Traditionally collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) involve a transfer of
collateral assets. The CDO liabilities then reference the cash flows
(principal and interest) of the collateral assets. But CDOs are increasingly
issued in synthetic form, where there is no physical transfer of collateral.
In these structures the CDO references default losses, rather than the cash
flows of the referenced collateral. 

Credit Default Swaps 

In their simplest form synthetic CDOs are akin to single name credit default
swaps. A credit default swap is a contract where one party ,the protection
buyer, makes periodic payments in exchange for payments contingent on a
credit event. In a single name credit default swap, the credit event is the
default of a single issuer. Thus, the price of the credit default swaps
reflects the market's view of the default likelihood of the reference name. 

In unfunded form a synthetic CDO is essentially a basket default swap. In
this case, in return for a premium, the protection seller makes contingent
payments based on the default losses incurred by a portfolio or basket of
assets. The protection may be for first loss or equity, in which case the
seller pays for the initial default losses, up to some threshold; second
loss or mezzanine, where the seller pays losses beyond the first loss
threshold up to some higher limit; or senior, where the seller pays all
losses beyond a threshold. 

Synthetic CDOs may also be structured in funded form. The simplest form of
this structure is a combination of a risk free bond and a basket default
swap. The initial investment is used to purchase the risk free bond and at
the outset the investor receives the risk free rate of interest from the
bond as well as premium payments from the basket default swap. As losses
occur on the reference portfolio the principal of the bond is reduced to pay
the required contingent payments. At the maturity of the structure the
investor receives the remaining principal of the risk free position. In both
funded and unfunded forms the pricing of synthetic CDOs is primarily a
matter of pricing the basket default swaps themselves. 

Correlation Products 

It is often said that synthetic CDOs are correlation products because their
value depends not only on the probability of default for each individual
name in the reference portfolio, but also on the correlation between those
names. Consider a simple case where the reference portfolio consists of two
names, each with a 5% probability of default. Assume two levels of
protection, one paying on the first default, and one paying on the second.
If the names are independent, then the probability that the first loss
protection is triggered is 1 - (0.95)2 = 9.75%, that is, 100% less the
chance that there are zero defaults. The probability that the second loss
protection is triggered is (0.05)2 = 0.25%, that is, only if there are two
defaults. On the other hand, if the defaults are perfectly correlated, then
there are only two possibilities: either both or neither of the names
default. Thus, the probability that either protection is triggered is the
probability that both names default, or 5%. Note that for the first loss
protection the increased correlation has reduced the likelihood that the
protection is invoked, and therefore reduced the fair price of this
protection. For the second loss piece, the increased correlation has
increased the trigger likelihood and fair price. 

The relationship between correlation and pricing holds generally for the
first loss and most senior levels of protection in basket default swaps. For
the first loss piece, since losses are capped, the pricing is driven
primarily by the likelihood that no losses occur, which increases with
correlation. For the senior piece, the pricing is driven by the likelihood
that an extreme loss occurs, which is greater in cases of higher
correlation. 

Pricing 

Based on the discussion above most pricing models require individual default
probabilities and a correlation across the names in the pool. Since
individual default probabilities can often be obtained from single name
credit-default swaps correlation is the main pricing parameter for synthetic
CDOs. 

Consider an example structure with USD36 million of collateral, where first
loss protects against the first USD5 million of losses, second loss protects
against the next USD10 million of losses, and the remaining losses are
protected by the senior tranche. We can model spreads on each of these
tranches at different correlation levels. For example, using a correlation
of 45%, we obtain model spreads of two basis points, 250bps and 1,642bps for
the senior, second loss, and first loss protection respectively. We can
repeat this exercise at different correlation levels to obtain the
sensitivity of spreads to changes in correlation. Figure 1 shows the
normalized cost of protection for each tranche at different correlation
levels. We can see that the cost of protection for the senior tranche
increases with increasing correlation, that is the cost increases as senior
debt gets riskier, while the first loss protection cost decreases with
increasing correlation, that is the cost decreases as equity gets less
risky. Note that, in this particular example the cost of second loss
protection behaves like senior as an increasing function of correlation. 

Implied Correlation 

We can back out an implied correlation for each tranche from CDO prices in
the same way we would obtain implied volatility from option prices and the
Black-Scholes pricing model. An implied correlation extracted in this
fashion depends on the specific CDO pricing model, but the observations
above hold generally. Suppose the market spreads for our example structure
are 2bps, 150bps and 2,000bps for the senior, second loss, and first loss
protection respectively. We can compare these observed spreads with our
model spreads to calibrate a correlation parameter for each tranche. For
example the model spread is equal to the observed spread for the senior
tranche, 2bps, when we price it using a 45% correlation. In other words, the
implied correlation for the senior tranche is 45%. The implied correlation
for each tranche can be inferred from Figure 1 as the correlation level with
which our pricing model recovers the observed market spread. We can see that
for the first and second loss tranches, the implied correlation is roughly
20%, while for the senior tranche the implied correlation is 45%. 

A first application of the implied correlation is to mark to market a
synthetic tranche on an ongoing basis. As we observe changes in the spreads
for the individual names in the pool, we can reprice the tranches above by
assuming the correlation level is constant, but updating the spreads.
Additionally, implied correlations can be used for relative value analysis.
For example, senior and second loss tranche protection increase in value as
correlation increases. Since both tranches depend on the same basket of
names, we would expect them to have a similar implied correlation. As
mentioned above, the implied correlation of the senior tranche (45%) is
significantly higher than that of the second loss tranche (20%). This means
that senior protection is expensive relative to second loss protection. We
can also perform relative value analysis across deals if we believe that the
pools in two different CDOs have similar characteristics, in terms of credit
quality, industry, and geographical distribution. For example, if two CDOs
have similar pools and structure we would expect to observe comparable
implied correlations for their senior tranches. All else being equal, a
discrepancy in implied correlation can serve as an indicator of a
discrepancy in price between the two structures. 


CFTC makes amendments to CFMA 2000
Risk News - October 29, 2001
By Naomi Humphries

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has released the final rules
relating to the trading of equity futures products in the United States.
These rules implement provisions of the Commodity Futures Modernisation Act
of 2000 (CFMA) that lift the 19-year ban on the trading of single-stock and
narrow-based stock index futures in the US. 

The final rules are in line with the new CFMA statutory provisions regarding
the specification of listing standards and conditions for trading security
futures products. The rules also establish requirements related to the
self-certification of rules and rule amendments, reporting of data,
speculative position limits, and special provisions regarding the contract
design for the cash settlement and physical delivery of security futures
products. 

The CFTC received comment from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the
Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex)
and the Intermarket Surveillance Group (ISG). The CFTC adopted several
revisions consistent with comments, but stated: ""Generally, the commentators
supported the proposed rules."" 

The CFTC also streamlined the trading process in its revisions of rules
governing commodity futures and options intermediaries on October 19,
following the enactment of the CFMA and the resulting revisions to the
Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Key rules governing intermediaries, including
futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, commodity pool operators
and commodity trading advisers, have been revised to provide greater
flexibility consistent with the mandate of the CFMA to streamline and
eliminate unnecessary regulation for entities registered under the act. 

They include a provision for retail customers to have broad access to
registered derivatives transaction execution facilities, by permitting them
to trade through a commodity trading adviser with $25 million or more in
assets under management, and a proposal to replace the current prescriptive
rule over ethics with a statement of acceptable practices. 

The CFTC claimed that comments from Fimat, a registered futures commission
merchant, and securities broker-dealer, Exchange Analytics, an ethics
training provider, the CBOT, the National Futures Association and the
Managed Funds Association, all generally supported the adoption of the
proposed amendments for commodity futures and options intermediaries. It
added that the issue that generated the most discussion was ethics training.


Acting chairman at the CFTC, James Newsome, said: ""These rules are just the
first step in the Commission's review of appropriate regulatory relief for
intermediaries. We have begun the intermediary study that Congress directed
us to perform, and we may well be implementing additional regulatory reforms
prior to the study's conclusion."" 



Banks tout economic derivatives
IFR - October 29, 2001

Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan will be using an auction mechanism to deliver
the new derivatives products, which they say will be self-clearing and
self-hedging. The solution licensed to the two banks to create derivatives
on economic statistics will also be applicable to corporate earnings and
revenues, mortgage prepayments, equity prices, central bank target rates,
index-related products, electric power, weather degree days, credit or any
event-driven market where the development of risk management tools has been
constrained by illiquidity, according to the developer of the solution, New
York-based Longitude.

""Once the mechanisms are up and running and validated, we could envision
structured notes on swaps linked to the auction process itself,"" said JP
Morgan Chase's Chris Harvey, managing director of foreign exchange and
interest rate derivatives sales for the Americas.

Deutsche Bank has picked Germany's lfo and Japan's Tankan as the debut
products for its economic derivatives franchises in Europe and Japan. JP
Morgan Chase is still in the process of selecting its inaugural US economic
statistics product.

JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank declined to disclose the cost of their franchise
on the economic derivatives. To retain their exclusive agreements with
Longitude for the Parimutuel Digital Call Auction (PDCA)-enabled
derivatives, the banks must meet performance benchmarks. Longitude charges a
fee based on the notional volume cleared through its system.

Using Longitude's PDCA bookrunner product, Deutsche Bank, for example, would
engage in pre-marketing or preselling activity that is similar to that in a
bond or equity syndicate offering, followed by a short auction period.
During the auction period, the bank would submit orders to buy or sell
digital options on the economic data covered to Longitude's web-based
system.

Upon receipt of the orders, Longitude's system produces bid/offer prices for
the derivatives being offered, and other relevant market equilibrium
statistics, such as limit order books. Longitude routes this information
back to the bank, which publishes the statistics for its customers. In this
example, Deutsche Bank would be counterparty to transactions that are
filled.

An order that is filled would result in an International Swaps and
Derivatives Association-documented transaction. The filled orders should
hedge themselves because in a pari-mutuel system all claims that end
in-the-money are funded by those out-of-the-money. ""Longitude's clients can
offer derivatives without assuming additional risks on their own balance
sheets,"" said Andrew Lawrence, chief executive of Longitude. As the systern
accepts orders with limit prices, capital markets participants can have a
high level of price certainty.

In a pari-mutuel system, prices are market-driven and determined by customer
participation, rather than a model or subjective assessment of the price of
risk.

Doubfers
""A pari-mutuel model is a demand and supply based market, so the question
becomes: Will there be enough participants?"" said Richard Sandor, chief
executive of Environmental Financial Products and one of the architects of
the interest rate futures markets.

""Is it view taking or [traditional] hedging? I'm not sure,"" said one bulge
bracket firm's head of market risk management.

Numbers of participants are difficult to predict because they will depend
upon the design of the specific auction, said Longitude's Lawrence. ""Perhaps
as few as 10-15 total orders can form a very rich auction equilibrium,"" he
said.

The cost of operating the call auction is another consideration. A high
transaction charge will mean less money for the winners. ""It varies from
market to market. But because banks are not taking market risk, the price
for the service will be modest,"" said Lawrence. ""In general, it has always
been considered extremely desirable to disaggregate risk factors to the
fullest extent possible because they can always be easily recombined.""

""Let's assume a health maintenance organisation (HMO) wishes to hedge out
its exposure to annual medical cost inflation in the US, and that the health
industry accounts for slightly less than 20% of US gross domestic product.
What can this HMO do now in the traditional markets to mitigate this risk?
Not much. But JP Morgan could offer derivatives based directly upon this
very important measure in order to offer a risk management product for this
HMO,"" he said.

Both JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are expecting early interest from financial
institutions, and fixed-income participants in particular, because no
mechanism for isolating and hedging or speculating on the growth rate of a
country's economy currently exists.

Deutsche Bank's strategy for introducing the new products will initially
hinge on drumming up internal interest, said Kevin Rodgers, global head of
currency options at Deutsche Bank in London. In January, the bank's trading
desks will start using it internally to hedge their own positions. This
activity will be useful in providing the bank with probability
distributions, he added.

Deutsche Bank will then try to get other banks' proprietary and swap desks
to use the system. The new products will probably be available for use by
hedge funds, commodity trading advisers and fund managers by the third
quarter of next year. JP Morgan Chase expects to start its franchise market
on US economic statistic derivatives next month.

HIGHLIGHTS

*	Viral Genetics has developed a revolutionary new technology called TNP which, based 
on clinical results to date, not only 
stops but also reverses the progression of HIV infection in people.
*	TNP is an extracted, naturally occurring, biologically active linear protein which, when 
purified and modified, greatly 
stimulates the body's immune response system.
*	Three months after an eight week TNP treatment, 8 out of 10 terminally ill AIDS 
patients in clinical trials show virtually no 
sign of HIV infection.

OVERVIEW

Viral Genetics, Inc. was founded in 1995 to develop and commercialize therapeutic and 
diagnostic systems for the treatment of 
viral diseases.  Their primary focus has been on finding a treatment which would stop and 
reverse the progression of HIV 
infection in humans.  After expenditures in excess of $8M, Viral Genetics developed their 
core technology - TNP (Thymus 
Nuclear Protein).

Since TNP's discovery, Viral Genetics has conducted numerous animal studies and three 
human clinical trials.  Each human trial 
consisted of 10 to 20 patients in the late stages of infection.  TNP was administered by intra-
muscular injection bi-weekly over 
an eight week period.  Follow up was carried out on all the patients anywhere from 50 to 
667 days after treatment.  The trials 
revealed the following incredible results with respect to TNP's efficacy and safety:

-	HIV viral levels were reduced by 90% even 18 months after treatment.
-	Patients experienced minimal side effects during treatment which completely subsided 
after treatment and remained that way 
even 18 months after treatment.
-	Dramatic reductions occurred even with HIV resistant strains that no Antiviral Drug 
Cocktail has shown any efficacy with 
whatsoever.
-	Most patients started to regain body weight during and after TNP treatment.

Viral Genetics is in discussions with a number of world wide governments to commercialize 
the TNP technology.

This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries.  Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.   For enrollment, or more information on these courses, please log on to http://elm.enron.com.","{}","Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.
